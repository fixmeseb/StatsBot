Salutations, esteemed learners.
We have a smorgasbord of information for you this week and for the weeks to come.
Enjoy!
Altered schedule this week—NO FLEX DAY
*	This week, we will run an altered schedule for the week, since we won’t have classes on Friday.  See information in the dates below.  WE WILL NOT HAVE A FLEX DAY THIS WEEK.
*	In one week, the 9th graders will all be on campus.
*	In two weeks, the entire Upper School will be on campus in Yellow Mode, except for those who elect to go completely virtual.
*	Seniors who drive can park in the US lot.
*	 Juniors and sophomores who drive should park on the hill.
Parking
And speaking of parking, please see Mr. Wacenske’s email earlier this week about leaving your car in the Upper School lot, rather than attempting to drive down to the tennis courts or lower fields for sports practices.  Those attempts will be gently rebuffed.
Lunch
*	In the next two weeks, we will institute some changes to Upper School lunch which should streamline the process.  Chef Sam is planning to open lines that allow for grab-and-go sandwiches and salads, leaving the four current lines open for the hot meals.  More to come soon.
*	Also, while we are in yellow mode this year, we will allow juniors to go off campus for lunch.  Please note: before any junior rolls a tire off campus during lunch time, we must have permission forms from parents, and you must sign the necessary forms.  We will get those out to you shortly.
Nominations
*	If you are interested, please submit an application for the Spector Family Fund Award by April 14th. Here’s the link to the application. <https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=lhwxmnBQl06DQlqL3lr76Xs5mw1iOzFLpvAArJHuLvBUNEs0OTVJS05WM1g0NUNTWldRUjY4MUhEVy4u&wdLOR=c0EAFAED1-C335-4CDE-8924-55E75D5C4D65>
*	Each year, we open our Mission Awards nominations to both faculty and students: here’s the link <https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=lhwxmnBQl06DQlqL3lr76QnVCnglWSBMnYotF-PyNP9UMkxSSVk5T1FBUEdaVlBWNkRTTU9SVVdXNC4u>  for students if you want to nominate one of your classmates.
*	Please see Mrs. Eason’s email regarding the Johnnetta Overton Scholarship.
Fun Coming Up
*	The PTAA has organized an Upper School Fun Day for April 7th.  They’ll have amusements and a Knockerball tournament going on throughout the day on Field #2. Grab some friends and sign up for a session! Seniors only for the 11:00 a.m. session, but 9-11th graders can choose either of the other time slots after. Your parents will have to sign a waiver before you’re allowed to participate, so be sure to sign up soon.  See Dr. McElreath’s email.
