Dear students,
Happy last week of August!
We have a short week this week, yet in true CA fashion, we are packing much into the two academic days prior to the trip.
On Monday, we have the Senior College Night.  Seniors, I trust this information does not surprise you.
On Tuesday, we will enjoy Picture Day.  All students will take photos during their history classes in the gathering spot in the Center for Math and Science.   If you are not taking a history class this year, then please have your photo snapped during your free period.  We also have a bevy of games on campus that afternoon—please come out and support your fellow Chargers.
Wednesday through Friday we will enjoy class trips.
We will begin clubs this Monday (tomorrow) with the following groups:
8/27
300 Seconds, ACSL, CA Steppers, COEXIST, German, Glee, History Day, Indoor Track, Open Art Studio, Outdoors, Philosophy, SciOly, Spanish, StuCo, SGE, Tech Teather, Trivia, USAYPT, Weight Training
Enjoy the following reminders:
9/3                       No school—Labor Day Weekend
