Salutations, esteemed learners.
The education keeps happening, both inside and outside the classroom, especially during this past week.  Remember: if you need to talk to an adult, feel free to reach out to a trusted community member.
*	This week, we enjoy a normal schedule; see Dr. McElreath’s email about the bevy of options available to you for Flex Day.
*	With Wednesday in mind, please see Dr. McElreath’s email as well regarding the MLK presentation.  Yes, it’s a bit different this year, courtesy of the pandemic, but please watch the presentation at one of the two announced times.  The presenter is an incredible speaker.
*	And, given the increase in COVID cases statewide and nationwide, please continue to be mindful of the three Ws: wash (your hands frequently), wear (a mask), and wait (six feet from others).  For your edification, I am including a link to the CA Compact page, which outlines all the detail about how to stay healthy in these times: CA guidelines <https://united.cary.academy/health-well-being/campus-guidelines/>
*	Just a reminder: Semester 1 report cards will be published on Monday afternoon.
Have a good week.
