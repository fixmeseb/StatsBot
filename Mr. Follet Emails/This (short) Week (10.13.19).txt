Salutations, esteemed learners.
After two normal days to start the week, we will have grade-level programming on Wednesday morning, with 10th and 11th graders taking the PSAT.  Sophomores and juniors, please make sure that you get enough sleep on Tuesday night so that you are awake for the standardized test.  As a bonus, the PTAA will be providing yumminess in the morning.  The 12th graders will enjoy their Senior Breakfast; the 10th and 11th graders will have pre-PSAT snack options; the 9th grade will have a snack part of the way through their morning programming.
After the morning activities, the Student-Parent-Teacher conferences offer all students a chance to reflect on successes in classes, along with areas of growth.
On an unrelated note, please be mindful of expectations around campus.  The Eno Village, for example, depends on certain rules: specifically, no more than one person should occupy a hammock, and students should avoid horseplay.  Because some students have been flouting those rules, we will need to remove the hammocks temporarily, especially since they have been damaged.
Enjoy the Monday and Tuesday of classes, followed by the other learning opportunities afforded by this unique week.
Regards,
Mr. Follet
