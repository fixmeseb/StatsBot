Esteemed students,
Thank you for all the energy you brought to the start of school.  As we start our first full week, I offer you these reminders:
*	We will have Club Fair on Friday at 2:45.
*	If you would like to have a locker, please see Mrs. Sengelmann.
*	Drop/Add continues through August 28th.  If you have questions about your schedule, please talk to Ms. Holland.
College Visits
Junior and seniors, if you want to meet with representatives from the various colleges who are on CAâ€™s campus this year, please consider the following:
*	If you will miss any portion of a class you must ask permission of the teacher to attend the college visit PRIOR to the class. The decision will be left up to each teacher as to whether you can miss class time.
*	All college visitors will meet in the Conference Room (U200) unless otherwise designated.
*	Tablets may be used with permission of the college visitor.
*	Make sure you come with questions to ask the college representative.
*	As always, food and drink are not allowed in the Conference Room
