Salutations, esteemed students.
This week, I remind you of two items:  first, we have the chance to enjoy The Music Man in the next few days.  Come out and support all the community members who crafted this incredible opportunity.  You can watch the show on Thursday, Friday, or Saturday of this week.  To purchase tickets, please contact Michael Hayes or Sara Mizelle.
Second, please take care of yourselves. Make sure, too, you wash your hands thoroughly and frequently.  Let us fight the spread of colds and flus.
This Week

Wednesday: American Math Competition in the Discovery Studio
Thursday: Senior lunch in the Discovery Studio.  In addition, the SEA lobby will be closed in the afternoon
