Dear students,
Yesterday, worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania experienced the worst anti-Semitic attack in recent US history, one that left 11 people dead and six wounded.
To address this national horror, the student leaders of Cary Academy’s Jewish Affinity Group and Co-Exist have reached out to the administration, asking one simple question: what can we do to help?  Look for communication from the leaders in the next day or two about how our voices at Cary Academy can join the other voices across the nation, a chorus of people and communities, of nationalities and religions, who stand with the members of the synagogue in Pittsburgh, declaring that love will win.
In the meantime, please continue to support each other.  As this past week’s Day of Dialogue demonstrated, we have common hopes and dreams, no matter the labels we sometimes assume for ourselves.
Thank you again to the leadership of JAG and Co-Exist; they should be communicating with you in the next day or two.
In the meantime, I offer the mundane details of our week:
Schedule
On Monday, we will follow a normal schedule.
On Tuesday, the Symphony Orchestra members will have an extra rehearsal during C Block on Tuesday morning, making up for a class that they missed this past Thursday.  We will also decorate hallways this afternoon.  All decorations must be in place by 5 p.m.
On Wednesday, we will revel in the Halloween Hallway contest.  Please consider dressing in appropriate costumes.  Look for a reminder email about the definition of “appropriate” from the Deans soon.  In the afternoon, all US hallways must be cleaned.
On Thursday, we will relax with a normal Thursday schedule.
On Friday, grandparents and special friends will be joining us on campus in the morning.
