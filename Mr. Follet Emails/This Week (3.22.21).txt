Happy Spring 2021!
I offer you oodles of good information.  Enjoy!
Schedule Fun
*	Next week (3/28-4/1), we will run an altered schedule for the week, since we won’t have classes on Friday.  See information in the dates below.
*	In two weeks, the 9th graders will all be on campus (unless you elect to go completely virtual).  Since the 9th graders have not yet been on campus going through classes as a full group, we are providing them that opportunity to get used to the Upper School in all its fully functional glory.
*	In three weeks, the entire Upper School will be on campus in Yellow Mode, except for those who elect to go completely virtual.
*	“Yeah, but what about lunch?”  We are looking at ways to streamline and simplify the process so that you can still enjoy the scrumptiousness from Chef Sam and his crew.
Nominations
*	If you are interested, please submit an application for the Spector Family Fund Award by April 14th. Here’s the link to the application. <https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=lhwxmnBQl06DQlqL3lr76Xs5mw1iOzFLpvAArJHuLvBUNEs0OTVJS05WM1g0NUNTWldRUjY4MUhEVy4u&wdLOR=c0EAFAED1-C335-4CDE-8924-55E75D5C4D65>
*	Each year, we open our Mission Awards nominations to both faculty and students: here’s the link <https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=lhwxmnBQl06DQlqL3lr76QnVCnglWSBMnYotF-PyNP9UMkxSSVk5T1FBUEdaVlBWNkRTTU9SVVdXNC4u>  for students if you want to nominate one of your classmates
Fun Coming Up
*	The PTAA has organized an Upper School Fun Day for April 7th.  They’ll have amusements and a Knockerball tournament going on throughout the day on Field #2. Grab some friends and sign up for a session! Seniors only for the 11:00 a.m. session, but 9-11th graders can choose either of the other time slots after. Your parents will have to sign a waiver before you’re allowed to participate, so be sure to sign up soon.  See Dr. McElreath’s recent email.
Kudos
The following students qualified for the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) by finishing either in the Top 5% of all AMC-12 or the Top 2.5% of all AMC-10 participants nationally. The AIME is a three-hour, 15 question test involving longer, even more challenging problems than on the AMC. Please congratulate these students when you see them!
