Salutations, esteemed students.
*	This week, I offer a shout out to all the clubs and activities that have managed to continue, even with the challenges of cohorts and Zoom calls, masks and safe distancing.
*	This week, thank you to CA WISE and SEEDS for organizing last week’s Spirit Week.  And congrats Juniors!
*	As well, kudos to the Speech and Debate team.  They have won oodles of individual and team awards over the past few months, but again—they’ve done it all virtually this year.
*	Bravo to CA’s Science Olympiad teams, who also competed this weekend.  Even though it was a relatively local competition, the virtual nature of it meant that it was more akin to a national competition; one of the teams was from Los Angeles.
*	And finally, kudos to USAYPT, who competed the weekend as well.  Thank you all for your flexibility, patience, and dedication.
*	As a reminder, for the health of the community, follow the three Ws: wash, wear, wait.
*	 And especially this winter, if you eat inside, please limit the number of people at tables.  We want you (and everyone in the community) to stay healthy.
*	Also, if you are staying home due to illness, medical, etc. and will be doing school virtually, please have a parent notify attendance@caryacademy.org <mailto:attendance@caryacademy.org> .
