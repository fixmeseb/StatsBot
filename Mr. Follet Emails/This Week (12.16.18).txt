Monday: We will enjoy a normal schedule.  The Food Drive and Penny Wars continue.
Tuesday: We will enjoy a normal schedule for the second day in a row.  The Food Drive and Penny Wars end today.  You can also enjoy hot chocolate and donuts in the Dining Hall lobby during break, courtesy of the PTAA.
Wednesday: We will follow a Friday schedule for the full day.
Thursday and Friday: We are on break for the holidays.
Kudos
Thank you to StuCo, NHS, and Beta Club for all their hard work this past week. Bravo to all of our teams and spectators on Friday—you showcased your spirit!  Kudos, too, to X-Factor, the CA Cheerleaders, and the PTAA for organizing a wonderful Homecoming Party.
