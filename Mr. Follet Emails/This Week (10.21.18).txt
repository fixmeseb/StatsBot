Salutations, esteemed students.
This Thursday, we will have an opportunity to engage in important conversations during an extended advisory time.  And while we will be discussing important matters (see Dr. Ehrhardt’s email from last week), just as importantly, we will work to develop skills centered on hearing differing viewpoints.
Now, on to the specifics…
Schedule
On Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, enjoy the normal Cary Academy schedule with all of its expected craziness.
On Thursday, we will still run double blocks, but in a slightly different order.  All the blocks will take place prior to lunch, allowing us time for the Day of Dialogue in the afternoon.  For more specifics, go to the gradebook, click on School Calendar, scroll down to Thursday, and click on Modified Schedule Upper School.  Click on Additional Info to see the schedule.
On Friday, we will enjoy Friday Night Lights in the evening.  Make sure you bundle up!
Kudos!
Congratulations to all of our fall athletes for the time and effort you dedicated to your sports.  On that note, the US Field Hockey team will be competing in the quarter finals for States on Tuesday.
Reminders
Sign in when you visit the library.  Cross the parking lot using the cross walks, especially during drop-off and pick-up.  Own your learning.  If you need to go to the nurse, come to the US Office first.  Find something that you enjoy each day.  Drive the speed limit while on campus.  Remember, the Zen Den is available for a quiet space.
