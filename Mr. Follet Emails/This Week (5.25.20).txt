Salutations, esteemed learners.
I hope that you are enjoying the beginning of our penultimate week for the school year.  In honor of all the weirdness this year, please enjoy your May snow day tomorrow.
On Wednesday and Thursday, we will follow our normal abnormal schedule.
On Friday, we will enjoy the Upper School End-of-Year Assembly, a combination of awards, class slide shows, and student speakers.  The show will include both live and pre-recorded elements.  More information will be sent out later this week.
Just a reminder: during the last week of the school year, we will run locker clean outs, uniform collections, tablet returns for the seniors, and yearbook distributions.  See my email from last week for more information.
