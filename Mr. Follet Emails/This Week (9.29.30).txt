Other announcements
*        I have attached a PowerPoint with the flow chart through the Upper School buildings; thanks to Mrs. Dungan for all her work behind the scenes, putting this information together.
*        A reminder: I sent a massive email on Friday with lots of juicy information.  Enjoy.
*        When you arrive at school, you will likely notice the new thermal cameras at the entrances of the US building and the CMS.
*        The cameras read skin temperature in the area around the forehead (margin of error: +/- .9 degrees)
*        If temperature reading is above 100.3, the system will trigger a notification that is sent to administrators.
*        The administrators will identify the person(s) triggering the notification and will follow up with the student
*        No data from the readings is retained
*        The thermal camera system does not replace performing daily personal checks of temperature, wellness or the CA United agreement
Kudos
A shout out goes to the CA Speech and Debate team, who competed last week, albeit virtually, at the Duke University tournament.  The team took third place overall (a huge achievement, given that teams from across the country were participating), and Alex Lim won in Humorous Interpretation.
