Salutations, esteemed learners.
Congratulations to all of you for a wonderful first week of DT/YES/WEP.  Enjoy these last few days before luxuriating through a magnificent Summer Break.
I offer you these points for consideration:
*	See Dr. McElreath’s emails regarding this week’s activities, along with details about June 4th, and remember, you are finished by noon that day.
*	The normal boundaries remain in place during Discovery Term.  In other words, you can stay on the Quad or in buildings around the Quad.  You should avoid visiting the Middle School, since classes are still in session.  You should avoid going off campus unless it’s a scheduled part of your DT or you have an appointment and you get permission from your parents, communicated to the Upper School attendance.
*	If you drive to school, please park on Fire Drill Hill.
*	Also, when you have a chance, please thank all the people who made this incredible year possible, from the teachers to the Dining Hall staff, from our cleaning crew to our Facilities team, just to name several groups of important people.
Have a good summer!
