Salutations, esteemed learners.
Huzzah!  We have a normal orange week for the first time.  And isn’t it strange how our definition of normal has changed?  Still, I hope that you had a chance to enjoy the Fall Break before we return to a week complete with cohorts, a Flex Day, and continued reminders from me about handwashing, distancing (six feet, and two to a picnic table), and mask-wearing.
Here are the necessary details:
Schedule:
For this week, normal!  Ish!
Midterm
October 8 was the Upper School Midterm.  We will be able to publish the Midterm Report by Friday of this week.  If you are happy with your learning in your classes, wonderful—you have more learning to come.  If you are not happy with your progress, wonderful—you have more learning to come.
Kudos
Bravo to the dialog facilitators and participants this past Wednesday.  You not only engaged in important discussions, but you also honed necessary skills involving how to engage in challenging conversations, skills necessary in our increasingly fractured and contentious world. Thank you for your leadership.
Kudos, too, to all the advisees who contributed to the flower mural now at the US entrance.  A special shout-out to Ms. Karen Rose, who ensured that our last student activity on campus this past spring during Ubuntu resulted in this incredible piece of art.
