Salutations, esteemed students.
Happy Sunday, albeit a slightly soggy one.
This week, during Flex Day, if you are a 9th, 10th, or 11th grader, know that Ms. Huntress Holland is leading Zoom presentations about course registration.  After the meetings, the information will still be available to you.  In fact, conversations with your advisors about the 2021-2022 school year will start after break.  In preparation for those conversations, Ms. Huntress Holland is ensuring that you have registration information in plenty of time to make informed decisions.
Here's the schedule for the Wednesdayâ€™s Zooms:
*	9 a.m.  9th grade Zoom
*	10 a.m. 10th grade Zoom
*	1 p.m.  11th grade Zoom
Enjoy a normal week, doing your best to stay dry.
And remember: the final week of February, we will have Flex Day on Friday.
