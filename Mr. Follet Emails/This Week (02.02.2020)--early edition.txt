Salutations, esteemed students.
I share giddy tidings with you: this coming week, we will be able to use the library again! Seniors will have the honor of being the first students to officially step feet in the space on Monday. All other US students may inhabit the space starting on Tuesday.
A note: the café will open at a later (though still relatively soon) date.
For further details of the week, see below.
Regards,
Mr. Follet
