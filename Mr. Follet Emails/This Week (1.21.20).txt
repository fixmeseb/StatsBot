Salutations, esteemed students.
We started the weekend well on Friday, watching the thought-provoking performance of Approximation of a Woman by Ms. Powell and her fellow dancers, and listening to the inspiring words of Mr. Freelon.  I hope you had a chance to reflect on those messages, ones which should continue to return to us.
