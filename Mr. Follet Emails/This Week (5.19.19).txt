Salutations, esteemed students.
We have a whirlwind final week of classes.  Make sure you look at the attached schedule.  In addition, I will send out emails to each grade on Monday, giving a bit more detail about your end of week activities.
This Week
Monday:             Enjoy a normal-ish day, even with the 12th grade prank, which reminds me: if you are a junior, and you park in the US lot, please plan to park on Fire Drill Hill.  The CMS Gym will be closed for Commencement set-up, and it will remained closed for the entire week.
Tuesday:             We will have a normal day.
Wednesday:       See attached calendar.  Students who usually park by the tennis courts will not be able to nestle their cars into those spots. Plus, we will enjoy the Yearbook Assembly and—for the seniors—Baccalaureate in the evening.
Thursday:           See attached calendar.  Plus, Huzzah for the Upper School End of Year Assembly.
Friday:                 See attached calendar.  Plus, Commencement!  Faculty, staff, and students will need to park on the hill.
