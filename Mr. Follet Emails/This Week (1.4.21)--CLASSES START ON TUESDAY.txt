Salutations, esteemed learners.
Welcome back, and Happy 2021!  I hope that you had a lovely, relaxing, healthy break.
We are returning from a wonderfully long two weeks.  As a reminder, for your health and the health of our community,
*	please stay home if you or anyone in your household is exhibiting signs of illness.  For more detailed information, please peruse Dr. Ehrhardt’s missive.
*	As well, please remember to complete your morning health check forms.
*	And, of course, wear your masks, wash your hands (frequently), and wait—keeping six feet of distance from others.
Please continue to do all you can to maintain the health of our community.
This week, classes begin on Tuesday; teachers are using Monday as a comment-writing day for Semester 1.  Here’s what the rest of the week looks like:
*	Tuesday: Monday schedule, Blue Cohort on campus
*	Wednesday: Tuesday schedule, Blue Cohort on campus
*	Thursday: Thursday schedule, Gold Cohort on campus
*	Friday: Friday schedule, Gold Cohort on campus
Your Semester 1 report cards, by the way, will be available online on the afternoon of Monday, January 11th.
Now that we are starting Semester 2, please review your class schedule, especially if you are taking an S2 class—you want to know where to go and when.
