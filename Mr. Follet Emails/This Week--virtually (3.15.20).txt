Salutations, esteemed learners.
I hope you and your families are all doing well, especially given that we are living through fascinating times.
As Dr. Ehrhardt announced in his previous email, we will be running virtual classes, starting on Wednesday, March 18th.  See the details below regarding virtuality.
The virtual class schedule
*	All assignments will be posted by NOON. Teachers may assign a task for classwork (including a virtual meeting) and a standard homework assignment may also be assigned for that class.
*	We will alternate between Monday and Tuesday classes. This week, Monday classes will take place on Wednesday and Friday.  Tuesday classes will take place on Thursday.
*	To coordinate the use of online tools for virtual class meetings, and to coordinate teacher availability for questions, all teachers and students will follow our “Virtual Day Schedule.”  All teachers and students are asked to be online and engaged for their classes with the following schedule:
A             12:00 - 12:30
B             12:30 – 1:00
C            1:00 - 1:30
D            1:30 - 2:00
E             2:00 – 2:30
F             2:30 – 3:00
G            3:00 – 3:30
The faculty and staff have already offered several excellent ideas for modifications to this schedule.  However, for the sake of simplicity and clarity, we will run this schedule until March 27th.  If need be, we can revise and improve the virtual schedule should our virtual days continue after the 27th.  And, of course, if you have any suggestions, please feel free to send them to me.
Other assorted items
Ms. Holland and I will be working out the details of course registration.  We will get back to you early next week with an update on plans.
Mission Awards—it’s that time.  In next week’s email missive, I will include a link for student recommendations.
In this time of uncertainty, please reach out should you have any questions.
Enjoy the two bonus days of Spring Break, followed by a bevy of pajama days.
Let me know if there’s anything you need from me or the other administrators, and I wish you the best of health.
Sincerely,
Mr. Follet
