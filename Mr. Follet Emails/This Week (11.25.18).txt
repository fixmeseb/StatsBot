Salutations, esteemed Chargers.
Welcome back!  I hope you had an enjoyable break, one filled with family, friends, food, and time for relaxation.  With the start of Trimester Two, make sure you are still making time for those items, even with all the fun that will fill your days.
Please scan the information below, especially regarding the details for this coming week.  Otherwise, have a spiffy start to the new trimester.
This Week’s Schedule
Monday: with the start of a new trimester, please check your schedules.

Also, if you are supposed to have a study hall, we will have the study halls built in the next few days.  In the meantime, please look for further direction from Ms. Holland about where to sign in.
