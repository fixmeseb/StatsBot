Greetings, sagacious ones.
I hope you enjoyed your three-day weekend, finding space to relax and spending some time outside.  Now that we’ve had a chance to take a breath, I wanted to remind you of three important ideas for this year.
*	Continue to own your own learning.  Reach out to teachers when you need help; we have time in the schedule now for those conversations.  In addition, consider how you can use Flex Days to embrace the idea of charting your learning growth (and shout out to the students and faculty who went on a bike ride through Umstead this past Wednesday—hence the illustration in today’s email).
*	Be patient with yourself and others.  This is a hard time, all compounded by the need to social distance and the uncertainty of how long the distancing will last.  We will make mistakes.  We will accomplish wonderous things.  Be patient.
*	Finally, take that patience and be proactive: find opportunities for kindness and connection.  There’s enough ugliness in the world right now; we can shine not only academically, but also socially and emotionally.  How can you support others?  Think about the kind words and actions you can offer.
Now, here are all the important details.
This Week’s Schedule
*	This week, we will not have our Wednesday Flex Day, since we have a shortened, four-day week courtesy of Labor Day.
*	Tuesday is a Monday Schedule
*	Wednesday is a Tuesday schedule
*	Thursday is a Thursday
*	Friday is a Friday
