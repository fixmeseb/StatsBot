Salutations, esteemed learners (and parents of esteemed learners).
For those of you new to Cary Academy’s Upper School, I send out a weekly missive to students outlining important topics and information for the coming five days.  I don’t normally copy parents on this email, since the students are wonderful about assuming responsibility for their schedules, but this week, with new students gaining access to their email and computers on Tuesday, I wanted to get information onto all computer screens in a timely manner.
Here’s a quick overview of this week:
*	Monday: 9th graders are invited to campus for an orientation, 1:00-3:00.  9th graders will receive a hard copy of their class schedules.
*	Tuesday: New 10s and 11s come to campus for an orientation, 11:00-12:30.
*	All new students have computer training from 1-3:00
*	Seniors are invited to campus for rock painting and car decorating from 1:30-3:30.
*	All Upper School student schedules are available online.
*	Wednesday: First day of school!  See attached schedule.  A quick note: normally, we attach altered schedules to the calendar.  Again, because we want to make sure that all have the necessary information, I am attaching the schedule to this week’s email.
*	Also, for simplicity’s sake, all academic courses and Art & Design courses will meet on Wednesday.  We will NOT run art electives on Wednesday.
*	Thursday: we will run an A Schedule
*	Friday: we will run a B Schedule
