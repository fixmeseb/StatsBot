Salutations and Happy Pi Day, esteemed learners.
Welcome back to the final quarter of the 2020-2021 school year.  Enjoy the warmer(ish) temperatures, the flowers, and the longer days.
*	March and April naturally bring spring sports.  For those of you who will be driving to school and who play sports, please park in the Upper School lot.  Do NOT drive down to the stadium or lower fields after school, since you will be turned away; we need those parking spots for visiting teams.
*	Kudos to CAâ€™s  Science Olympiad team.  They competed over break, earning high marks.  The JV1 and JV2 teams did well, and the Varsity placed 4th, so they will be competing at the state tournament in late April.
*	If you are a 10th grader, remember that you will be taking the PSAT10 on campus this Wednesday.
Now enjoy this most mathy of days as you revel in the final few hours of break.
