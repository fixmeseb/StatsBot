Salutations, esteemed students.
Here’s to a good week.  Please peruse the details below.  Before you do so, consider checking out CA’s theater production, The Theory of Relativity—see your email from this past week for the details.
Dress Code
Please follow it.  If you have questions, ask a dean.  Not sure where to read about the Dress Code?  Look for “US Handbook” under Resources in your Blackbaud portal, and then search the handbook for the dress code.
Lunch
Clean up after yourselves.  Clean up after your friends.  Keep the campus clean.  Thank you.
COVID testing
Want or need to take a COVID test?  CA provides that opportunity.  All students are eligible. Testing is from 2:30pm to 5:30pm Tuesdays in the Dining Hall.
