Salutations, students.
Welcome to fall and the first five-day week this month.  I offer you the following tidbits of information.
Schedule Items
On Friday, we will arrive at the midterm of Trimester 1.  If this fact fills you with giddy joy, just remember that we have another ½ trimester left; if this fact fills you with horror and trepidation, just remember that we have another ½ trimester left.  During the first week of October, we will publish the midterms for you and your parents.  With that information in mind, you will have useful data for our upcoming conferences during the second week of October.
Also, I will hold an open forum for student questions and feedback on Thursday, September 27th in U201 during Community Time.  Feel free to stop by.
