Salutations, esteemed students.
Once again, we enter a corridor of fun, sometimes alternate schedules.  This week, we will enjoy an NHS speaker (look for info about the speaker soon), followed by Halloween (and permission to dress in costumes that are dress-code appropriate).  The week culminates with a late start, due to Grandparents’ and Special Friends’ Day.
For more specifics, see below.  Otherwise, enjoy the week!
Mr. Follet
The schedule
Monday: We glide through a normal day.
Tuesday: We learn from an NHS speaker.  Remember, we are following an altered schedule today.
Wednesday: We take the afternoon after school to prep for the Halloween Hallway contest.
Thursday: We embrace the wackiness of Halloween.
Friday: We have a late start; classes begin at 9:30.  US students and faculty should park on the hill.
Kudos:
Mr. Noland shared the following:
“The first problem of the week was solved only by freshman Haitian Huang. The solution is posted in the CMS math hallway as well as a new problem to try. Come check it out.”
Kudos, too, to the cast and crew of “When Suddenly…”  They all did a fantastic, funny job.
