Salutations, esteemed learners.
Welcome back from the Labor Day weekend. From all reports, it sounds as if you had an enjoyable set of class trips.  Thank you again for representing Cary Academy well in all your travels, whether you were journeying to the mountains of Virginia, to local destinations, to Washington, D.C., or to Myrtle Beach.
This week, we start on a Tuesday, so we will follow a Tuesday schedule tomorrow.  The rest of the week is normal.
The juniors will also start their parking rotation this week; 1/3 of them will be parking by the tennis courts, along with all the sophomores who drive to school.  However, due to a large number of campus guests on September 6th, we may need to adjust parking requirements for that day.  Look for an email from Mrs. Eason a little later this week.  On a related note: if you drive to school, you must have completed a parking contract for this year.
For your edification, please consider the following clubs and the days they meet:
Sept 6:
Beta, Key, Math, Open Art Studio, USAYPT
Sept 7:
300 Seconds, Academic Outreach, Chess, Chinese, Dance Team, DDD!, HLAG, HOSA, Investment, ISAG, Knitting, Rhymers, Robotics, S.T.E.P., SADD, Tabletop Games, Ultimate, USAYPT, X-Factor
"
Juniors and seniors, we have a bevy of colleges visiting this week: please see the CA calendar for a complete list.
On an unrelated note, if you are interested in volunteering for the North Carolina Football Club for a doubleheader on September 8th, please see Dr. McElreath for details.
And now, enjoy this list of important dates:
