Salutations, esteemed learners.
I hope that you are all doing well, enjoying the Homework Free weekend and finding some time to relax a bit before the final T2 push.
Our environmental gurus have asked that I pass along this good reminder: items other than napkins and food waste have been placed in the composting carts which contaminates the entire cart, meaning that the contents can’t be composted.  Please make sure that you attempt to compost only the compostable items.
Have a lovely week.
Regards,
Mr. Follet

This weekend, a number of Charger groups proved active.
The US Robotics team hosted their own tournament on Saturday, showcasing two nimble and fast robots.
The USAYPT team traveled to Philips Exeter to participate against a number of other national and international teams.  Just now, I learned that they WON the tournament!  Congratulations!
Our Upper School winter athletes will be participating in state competitions this week.  Go Chargers!
