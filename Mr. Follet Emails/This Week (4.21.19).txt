Salutations, esteemed learners.
Today, almost one month after an attack on two mosques in New Zealand, three Sri Lankan churches were bombed, resulting in over two hundred casualties on one of the holiest days in the Christian calendar.  The actions took place thousands of miles away, but they have ripple effects throughout the world as leaders of all faiths condemn extremism.  I am reminded, once again, of student voices in earlier conversations at CA: we need to find ways to support each other and our communities, using our words and deeds to help and to heal.  Please continue to search out those opportunities.
On more mundane notes…
This Week
*	Monday: We have a 10 a.m. start.  With the altered schedule, we will start in C Block.  See the calendar for more details.  In addition, juniors, please park on the hill, providing room in the US lot for parents who will need the spaces in the afternoon.
*	Tuesday: All who park by the tennis courts will need to park on the hill.  No student may drive down to lower campus, especially given all the games on campus.
*	Wednesday:  Wednesday is the deadline for online course registrations.
*	Thursday:  Enjoy the AP Pre-Admin session.  See the calendar for details.
*	Friday:  Friday is Friday!
