Salutations, esteemed learners.
Kudos to StuCo and X-Factor for all the spirit last week!  I’m looking forward to their plans for us in the coming weeks; I know that have quite a few ideas.
For the details of this short week, see below.
Schedule
This week, we will have a relatively normal four days, following the new schedule that was announced last week.  On Friday, we will have no school, which in our virtual world means that no work/homework assignment can be given on Friday.
Awards
At the end of each school year, we hold an End-of-Year Assembly, one that includes mission award winners.  Whether we hold a virtual or face-to-face version of the assembly, we still need your input.  Want to nominate one of your classmates for a mission award?

Survey results
*	In results that surprised me, 53% of you (or 112 respondents) said that pancakes were the preferred breakfast.  43% (or 90) lobbied for waffles.  4% (or 9) believed that neither choice was the best.

The schedule for clubs should look eerily familiar, as it’s the same schedule that we used last week.
