{"prompt": "This Week (1.18.22)##SEPERATION##", "completion": "Salutations, esteemed learners.\nOn this day celebrating Martin Luther King Jr, please take some time to reflect on the voices of the people around us.  In the time since Dr. King’s passing, many people and politicians have used his words, sometimes celebrating his ideas, sometimes using snippets of his speeches toward their own ends.  So much of what he wrote, though, focused on elevating the voices of the marginalized, on bringing their experiences to the attention of our larger society.\nThere is much we can do to improve our society.  One of the surest ways is to hear the voices, the concerns, of those who often have not been heard, and then honor those concerns with appropriate action.\nNow, regarding more prosaic matters:\nThis Week’s Schedule\n*\tTuesday follows an A Day Schedule\n*\tWednesday follows a B Day Schedule\nHealth Measures\n*\tContinue to wear masks inside and outside.\n*\tContinue to eat and drink outside.\n*\tThis week, the 9th and 10th graders can enter the Dining Hall at noon.  If we need to slow down the line, we will ask the 11th and 12th grade students to wait until 12:10 at the latest.\n*\tAndor lab will be on campus for testing this week on Tuesday from 2:30pm-4:30pm (the usual testing date and time) and Thursday from 3-4pm.\nClubs\nTues Ann Week Clubs\nClubs\nFaculty\nDay\nWeek\nMeeting Times\nRoom\nApp Design Club\nLingle-Martin\nMon\nAll\n8:30-9:10am\nC125\nUSAYPT <https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_ZGRjMzY1ZGMtNTczNy00OTQwLThjZDMtZTZjMjExMWJmOTg2%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%229a311c96-5070-4e97-8342-5a8bde5afbe9%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%229e774c4f-3027-45cf-8909-e6fede9f8ef6%22%7d>\nGreenwolfe/Kelly/Coven\nMon\nAll\n8:00-9:10\nC141\nStartup Challenge <https://caryacademy.zoom.us/j/339801263?pwd=Y0hHZ1h4Q3o5Y25hREhMaEh5K3Bodz09>\nSeeley\nMon\nAnn\n8:00-9:10\nU108\nWed am -

For the community’s safety, we will put a number of measures in place that should help us minimize the risk of COVID transmission at CA.\nHealth Measures\nFor the next several weeks, we will emphasize the following:\nMask wearing\n*\tWear your masks correctly, which means that the mask needs to cover your mouth and nose.  You will be asked to see a Dean if you are not able to wear your masks correctly, and you should expect a detention.\n*\tIf you forget your mask in the morning, please come to the entrance to the US or the CMS to grab one.\nSmall Library Conference rooms\n*                For the next three weeks, the small glass conference rooms in the Library will be closed to students.\nEating and drinking\n*                Please eat and drink outside, even if you are grabbing a snack.\n*                Unless we are experiencing inclement weather, please eat lunch outside.\n*                To ensure that the dining hall is not crowded, we will have staggered entrance times for lunch.\n*\tThis week, the 11s and 12s can enter the dining hall at noon\n*\tThe week, the 9s and 10s can enter the dining hall at 12:10.\n*                Starting later this week, Juniors will have off campus lunch privileges.  You will receive more information in your Tuesday Grade Level meeting.\n*                When you enter the dining hall, please use hand sanitizer.\nAnd remember: please wear your mask inside and outside the buildings, unless you are eating.\nThis Week\nBecause of our need to avoid large gatherings, we will NOT have a Community Day this Wednesday.  Instead, we will have a modified C Day schedule.\n*\tMonday and Tuesday: normal\n*\tWednesday—a modified C Day.  See the attached schedule\n*\tThursday and Friday: normal\n*\tAnd, just a reminder: Monday, January 17th is the MLK Jr. holiday; we will have no school that day.\n*\tWe will have COVID testing all week.

{"prompt": "This (short) Week (1.6.22)##SEPERATION##", "completion": "Salutations, relaxed learners.\nI hope that you’ve had an enjoyable break; in fact, you have several more days, so please enjoy that time after perusing this email.\nAs with everything else related to COVID, the pandemic has continued to create fluid situations.\nIn her message to the Middle School parents, Ms. Huntress Holland summed up the situation perfectly:\n“It is critical that students returning to school are not unknowingly carrying the virus. While data shows that schools have not been a source of spread and omicron does not seem to be as dangerous as delta, a campus outbreak would still cause serious disruption and stress -- impeding the learning [for all]. In addition, our hospitals are overwhelmed -- and we don't want to contribute to this ongoing health-care crisis.\nTo help make testing as easy as possible, we have added an additional clinic this week. Testing is available on campus two days next week: Monday, January 3 from 3:30pm to 5:30pm and Tuesday, January 4 from 2:30pm to 4:30pm. Both clinics will take place in the Dining Hall.”\nUS students, please consider getting tested, especially if you travelled this break, or if you were in crowded areas.  We want to ensure that everyone in our community stays safe.\nWith that idea in mind, and given the surge in COVID over the break, we will require you to wear masks both indoors and outdoors until at least January 28th, unless you are eating and drinking.\nNow, on to the details:\nSchedule\nMonday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: no school\nThursday: normal Thursday A Day Schedule\nFriday: normal Friday B Day Schedule\nKudos\nBravo to everyone involved in Spirit Week.

{"prompt": "This Week (12.6.21)##SEPERATION##", "completion": "Salutations, esteemed learners.\nWhat a wonderful start to December!  To keep the joy going, the PTAA has kindly arranged for Dusty Donuts to grace us this Tuesday during lunch.  Please snag a donut , and make sure to offer a “thank you” to the parents who are helping with the treats.\nOnce again, this week we will have an altered schedule.  See the details below.  Why the change, you ask? (And many of you have).  Due to COVID reasons outside of our control, we had to move Upper School home swim meets to the Triangle Aquatic Center this year.  TAC was generously able to accommodate us, but we had to work around their schedule, so our swim meets need to take place during the day.  Of the six home meets, five would directly impact Thursday A Schedule days, which is why we flipped this week’s A and B schedules—that way, those A Block classes aren’t effected as much.\nThe good news—we don’t have plans to make many more schedule alterations for the next several months.\nHave a great week, and make sure you enjoy the tasty goodness provided by the PTAA.\nThis Week (12.6.21)\nMonday: A Schedule\nTuesday: B Schedule\nWednesday: X Day\nThursday: B Schedule\nFriday: A Schedule\nNext Week (12.13.21)\nSpirit Week, including Wacky Olympics and the Pep Rally!\nKudos\nThe National Honor Society is sponsoring a Bake Sale from 12/7 to 12/10; they will be selling cookies and hot cocoa, and they will be donating proceeds to UNC’s COVID-19 Response Fund.  Look for more information soon.\nReminders\n*\tFor the foreseeable future, we will have voluntary weekly PCR COVID testing every Tuesday, from 2:30 – 4:30 p.m. in the conference room adjacent to the Dining Hall.\n*\tWhen you enjoy your time in the Library, please keep the noise down, whether you are there during lunch time or during free periods.

And a special shout out to the Upper School students who supported the Middle School athletes, cheering them on.  #oneschool.\nHere’s to another lovely fall week.\nThis Week\nWe will have a normal schedule on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.  See the attached document for the modified C Schedule we will run on Wednesday.\nReminders and Important Tidbits\n*\tAvoid speeding or incautious driving on campus.  Do you know the speed limit on campus?  Gotta love your prime numbers.\n*\tThe parking lots are off-limits during school hours.  If you need to go to your car, please check in with the Upper School office first for permission to venture into the off-limit areas.\n*\tFor the foreseeable future, we will have voluntary weekly PCR COVID testing every Tuesday, from 2:30 – 4:30 p.m. in the conference room adjacent to the Dining Hall.\n*\tPlease pick up after yourselves at lunch.

{"prompt": "This Week (8.30.21)##SEPERATION##", "completion": "Salutations, esteemed learners.\nAn Upper School student reached out to me this weekend, asking me to remind the Upper School student body of the world outside our walls.  He specifically mentioned the sacrifices of 13 American troops who died in a suicide bombing outside the Kabul airport this past Thursday, an attack that also led to 169 Afghan deaths.\nThe student’s request is important: it reminds us that we need to be cognizant of people’s stories, their histories that are actually our histories.\nAnd even as I am writing this note, reflecting on the student comment, I am watching the news, watching as history is unfortunately being made again, just a little closer to home: a massive hurricane is barreling into Louisiana, more or less on the 16th anniversary of Katrina, the storm that killed thousands.\nSome days, it feels as if our lives are bound by the bubble of CA.  Ultimately, though, our lives extend beyond those boundaries; we are members of a larger community.  And for the health of that community, we need to honor stories, to hear each other, to act for—and to act with—the people around us, literally and figuratively.\nThank you to all of you who search for ways to honor, support, and celebrate our larger communities.\nNow, for the quotidian details of the week:\nThis week\nWe will enjoy a normal week with our first X Day.  Remember, on Wednesday we start the day at 9:15 with advisory, unless you are on a trip that leaves earlier.\nMasks\nThank you to the all the students who have been wearing masks diligently and correctly.  Please continue to do so.  To those of you who chronically struggle to wear your masks correctly, please know that you will be invited to chat with an administrator about respecting the health of our community if mask-wearing continues to be an issue.\nCollege Rep Visits for Juniors and Seniors\n*\tThis year, college reps are able to visit in-person, as well as over Zoom.

{"prompt": "This week (4.19.21)##SEPERATION##", "completion": "Salutations, esteemed students.\nThe news this week reminded all of us that while we are working through one pandemic, the other one continues to rage—the one centered on the lack of equality and equity.  Black communities continue to work under the constant pressure of threats to their safety, to their lives. The Asian and Asian-American communities continue to deal with the rise in hate crimes.  And this past Thursday, the Sikh community experienced violence yet again.\nSeveral adults with whom I spoke on Friday mentioned feeling overwhelmed given the weight of the pressures, all coming to bear through the news of trials and killings over the past few days, which only echo years and decades and centuries of violence.\nIt feels bleak.  Again.\nIn that context on Friday afternoon, several US administrators and I listened to a presentation by leaders of COEXIST.  Those 12th graders gave specific suggestions about how to make our community stronger, to help it embrace diversity, equity, inclusion, and anti-racism more effectively.\nImplicit in their words was the message that we cannot undo four hundred years of racism and violence in our nation, but our individual actions can make small differences in our community right now.  And right now, even small differences are important.\nThank you to the COEXIST leaders, as well as all the affinity groups, for their convictions, for their willingness to ask that we make positive changes in our community.  We can’t make the world perfect—at least not right now.  But we can make Cary Academy better.\nIn the final weeks of this school year, please continue to support each other.  Continue to push back against this other pandemic.

{"prompt": "This Week (1.31.22)##SEPERATION##", "completion": "Salutations, esteemed learners.\nI hope you are doing well.\nThis week and into the future, I have two requests of you, and they both involve social media.  And no—I won’t tell you that Instagram and Tik Tok and Snapchat are leading to the downfall of our society.  Most adults actually appreciate social media, that lovely repository of heartwarming pet videos, recipes for every dish, and the latest dances and/or bits of teen culture that adults should never, ever, imitate.\nAnd really, who doesn’t enjoy a good post about golden retrievers?\nHowever, social media is generally lousy for nuanced discussions, which leads to my two requests:\n1.\tHave a concern with someone?  Talk to them, face-to-face. If that doesn’t work, talk to an adult.  Practice having discussions, even challenging ones.\n2.\tIn addition, please avoid taking and sharing pictures of people without their consent.  We all want to keep control of our images and our stories.  And since none of us is starring in the current blockbuster movie or scoring the winning point in a national competition, let’s eschew taking and posting pictures of others without their permission.\nIn short, we spent the last several years interacting through our computer screens; let’s take some time to make sure that we interact mask-to-mask now.\nRegarding the more pedestrian matters of the week:\nThis Week’s Schedule\n*\tWe have a normal schedule!\n*\tWe have an X Day on Wednesday!\nIn Two Weeks\nDuring the week of Valentine’s Day (Feb 14-18), CA SEEDS and StuCo will be hosting a “Love the Earth” Spirit Week with daily environmental challenges. It will be accompanied by a week-long sneaker drive through GotSneakers, a recycling organization that recirculates and repurposes sneakers in any condition.

Participants can bring in a maximum of five pieces to exchange for five, so be sure to start preparing now!”\nA Word (and blog link) from the CA Chapter of STAR\n“STAR (Students Together Assisting Refugees)is a national club dedicated to improving the lives of refugees. With the help of Ms. Follet and Ms. Ferraro, STAR was able to become a reality and the club was able to host a successful Paper Products Drive. For the monthly blog that helps raise awareness about the refugee crisis, follow this link: https://blogs.caryacademy.org/star/\nA Word about CA artists\n“The Eastern North Carolina Regional Art Awards is an annual event with a regional and national competition.

{"prompt": "This Week (3.21.22)##SEPERATION##", "completion": "Salutations, esteemed learners.\nDr. Ehrhardt shared with us that we are going mask optional, starting today.  Hurray!  We have the option of seeing each other’s faces.  With that in mind, I humbly ask that your remember our core values of respect, integrity, and compassion.  If you choose to wear a mask during optional times, excellent!  Wonderful for you!  Thank you for looking out for your health and ours!  If you choose to eschew the mask during optional times, wonderful!  We have missed our smiling visages too much for the past two years.\nAll of this is to say, continue to be kind and supportive of each other, no matter your mask-wearing decision.  And remember—there will be times when we ask that you wear masks: for example, when we have full US assemblies in the Theater.\nFor now, enjoy that sheer joy of having the option to wear masks or not at most times.  May we all remain healthy enough that this privilege continues.\nAnd now, for the quotidian details:\nThis Week’s Schedule\nMonday: A Day.  Bridge to the Upper School for 8th grade students and their parents.  Seniors, please park on Fire Drill Hill.\nTuesday: B Day\nWednesday: A Day\nThursday: B Day and Spring Shoppe.  Please park on Fire Drill Hill\nFriday: Grandparents’ Day and Spring Shoppe.  Please park on Fire Drill Hill.\nSpring Shoppe\nWe will have quite a few vendors and visitors on campus from March 24 to March 26, all of whom are visiting the Spring Shoppe.  If you are a student driver, we ask that you park on Fire Drill Hill those days.  You may visit the Shoppe during your free periods, should you wish.\nMission Awards\nRemember that incredible presentation one of your classmates did in class several weeks ago?  Or were you impressed with the selfless leadership that someone quietly demonstrated in the fall?  Want to nominate those students for a major end-of-year award?

{"prompt": "This Week (8.24.20)##SEPERATION##", "completion": "Salutations, esteemed students.\nHappy second full week of virtual classes. During the next five days, we will embrace our virtuality, courtesy of two important activities. The seniors will enjoy the virtual Senior College Night on Monday. On Wednesday, all US students will be able to participate in some way in the virtual Club Fair. More information should be coming soon.\nAs a reminder, when you are on campus, please continue to practice the three W’s: wear a mask, wash your hands, and wait (making sure you are six feet apart from each other).\nHave a spiffy week.\nThis Week\nMonday: You will meet A-D blocks. Senior College Night also takes place this evening, virtually.\nTuesday: You will meet E-G blocks and advisory.\nWednesday: We will enjoy our virtual Club Fair, along with other Flex Day activities. See Dr. McElreath’s email for more details.\nThursday: You will meet A-D blocks.\nFriday: You will meet E-G blocks and advisory.\nSchedule updates\n*\tJust a reminder: Add/Drop ends on August 28th.\n*\t9th graders, you do not have room in your schedule for more than 1 elective this year. Pandemic protocols for spacing, the need to fluctuate seamlessly between virtual and cohorts, and the integrity of our arts programs are the reasons driving this decision.

{"prompt": "This Week (8.17.20)##SEPERATION##", "completion": "Salutations, esteemed learners.\nIt was wonderful seeing so many of you on campus this past week.  Before we close out our extended, week-long Convocation, please enjoy these sagacious words from your student leaders: https://youtu.be/tsJg4z-3hL4  Many thanks to Michael Hayes, Aaron Yontz, and Steven O’Neill for taping and editing these speeches.\nNow, enjoy the start of your classes!\nThis Week\nMonday: classes begin.

Pandemic protocols for spacing, the need to fluctuate seamlessly between virtual and cohorts, and the integrity of our arts programs are the reasons driving this decision.  As a result, you’ll need to either take a yearlong elective or choose one elective each semester, or even take a free period.\nMessage for 9th and 10th graders:\n*\tThis year, your classes called Health I (for 9th graders) and Health II (for 10th graders) will be fully virtual through The Virtual High School, one of our trusted online learning centers.

The fall course will start on September 15th.\nFlex Day information\nDr. McElreath offers the following information about Flex Day:\nFlex Day is a new opportunity for our community, and it will greatly expand our ability to schedule cool experiential learning opportunities, of all kinds. These will include events that help us build our own community, support the wider community through service, create art/tech/connections, and explore a huge range of topics that all of you can propose. It will take us a little time to fully realize its potential, but there are already some great options for you to choose this coming Wednesday. Please see the SignUp Genius at THIS LINK <https://www.signupgenius.com/go/30E0F48A4AF28A13-8192020>  and choose among those events available to your grade level. Note that some events have a limit on capacity, so the sooner you sign-up, the better. (The Center for Community Engagement, which coordinates Flex Days, would like sign-ups completed by Tuesday at 8am.) Email the contact person for each event if you have any questions.\nIn the times when you are not signed up for anything specific on the Flex Day calendar, we encourage you to still make the most of a flexible day for learning as well as tending to your needs. Here are 10 things you might do that require minimal/no screen time (culled from the recent Flex Day survey many of you completed):\n1.\tRead a book\n2.\tMake some music\n3.\tLearn sign language\n4.\tTake a hike\n5.\tPlan a new non-profit or business\n6.\tCollege research or apps (Seniors)\n7.\tSchedule a time to meet with a teacher\n8.\tWrite your grandparents a real letter\n9.\tPlay sports or games\n10.\tVisit someone who could use some company\nUpcoming dates\n8/17                    Classes start virtually\n9/7                      Labor Day—no school\n9/8                      Classes may move to orange mode, with cohorts on campus two times per week\n10/9                    Semester 1 midterm\n11/16-11/27      Thanksgiving Break\n12/18                  Last day of Semester 1\nHave a good week!\nRobin Follet\nHead of Upper School\nCARY ACADEMY\n1500 N.

{"prompt": "This Week (6.1.20)##SEPERATION##", "completion": "Dear students,\nOn Friday, I had the pleasure of announcing the missions awards, all of them centered around our values as a school.  It’s a time that I love, because I know that these awards are just a sampling of how you embrace respect, integrity, compassion, discovery, innovation, collaboration, and excellence in your everyday lives.\nAnd then yesterday, like many of you, I watched events unfold after George Floyd’s killing and the subsequent protests.  Seeing that horror, one so emblematic of the experiences of minority communities, but especially of the African American community, I kept returning to one line that I read on Friday about this year’s Overton Scholarship recipient, a fellow student who offers kindness to all but also  “speaks her truth loudly and clearly.”\nAnd I remembered our Service Award winner, a student who decided to put others’ needs in front of his comfort.\nAnd I remember a Community Award winner, a student who joyfully encourages others, both in word and deed.\nYes, you are becoming scientists and writers and historians and artists and thinkers and polyglots and mathematicians.  But more importantly, from what I’ve seen over this year and through the words of your peers and teachers, you are becoming agents of improvement.   You are watching out for community, and you understand that “community” extends far beyond the roll sheet of who is in your grade, or who is associated with Cary Academy.  And goodness knows, we need agents of improvement now.\nI started the year by asking you to be kind to yourselves and each other.  I end the year with a corollary request: be kind to others, listen to those who are speaking their truths, and continue to make changes for the betterment of our community.\nNow, regarding the quotidian details of our final week:\nMonday:             Graduated seniors return their tablets and cleanout lockers.  See Mr. Jones’s email regarding the details.\nTuesday:             9th and 10th graders clean out lockers and return uniforms.\nWednesday:       11th graders clean out lockers and return uniforms.\nThursday:           Last day of synchronous classes\nFriday:                 Last day.  The graduated seniors will also pick up their yearbooks from 11:30-1.\nSaturday:            Students in grades 9-11 can pick up yearbooks from 10:00-11:30.\nHave a good, safe week and summer.  I can’t wait to see you in person soon.\nRegards,\nMr. Follet\nRobin Follet\nHead of Upper School\nCARY ACADEMY\n1500 N.

The strangeness of the past trimester does not diminish your learning throughout high school; rather, it highlights your ability to deal with the challenges that life creates.

Enjoy this final week.\nAs well, kudos to StuCo; they are in the process of organizing one final Spirit Week before the seniors leave us.

{"prompt": "This Week (5.10.20)##SEPERATION##", "completion": "Salutations, esteemed students.\nAs we glide into the middle of May, we begin AP tests for 11th and 12th graders, and we start the countdown for seniors, who are done on May 22nd.   As well, we are clarifying the end of the year—those two weeks after the seniors are done with classes.  Early next week, we will be able to provide more information about locker clean out, library book collection, and yearbook distribution.\nIt’s been a long trimester for a number of obvious reasons, and the pace of the next two weeks will only make the end that much busier.  For that reason, we will have an Upper School Snow Day on Tuesday, May 26th.  What does that mean?  You won’t have any classes or asynchronous work in the Upper School.  Think of it as a bonus vacation day after Memorial Day.  In addition, on Friday, May 29th, we will have our Upper School Awards Assembly starting at 1 p.m.  Yes, it will be virtual.  No, we will not have classes that day.\nIt’s been a strange end to the year.  But once again, I am appreciative of your humor, your willingness to support each other, you ability to engage in challenging circumstances, and your quirky Zoom backgrounds.\nFor more bits of goodness, please continue reading.\nKudos\n*\tBravo to the Emotional Health students who—with Ms. Monds’s help—are offering stress-relieving options to the students prepping for AP tests.\n*\tKudos to Allie Chandler, who “won the Catalyst for Change Prize at the 2020 GOA Catalyst Conference.”  The judges at the Global Online Academy added, “We had 356 projects presented at the conference; 77 of them received GOA Citations; six of them, including [Allie’s], are now receiving the Catalyst for Change Prize. Congratulations!”\n*\tThank you, too, to all student leaders who are making sure that we support each other in a variety of ways.\nAP test schedule this week\nCourtesy of the College Board, here are the AP tests for this week.

Star Wars aficionados, and even those slightly familiar with the films, take the opportunity to declare, may the fourth be with you.  In honor of May 4th, please let us know which film dynasty you prefer.\n*\t34.65% Avengers\n*\t28.35%               Harry Potter\n*\t26.77%  Star Wars\n*\t7.09% Other\n*\t3.15% Star Trek\nIn the comments section, several other series were mentioned, including Shrek, Lord of the Rings, Mission Impossible, and Game of Thrones (but not season 8).\nAnd then someone added this analysis:\nThis is not another choice, but I'd like to argue that the Star Wars prequels had so much potential that they should be revamped. There were so many great narratives to follow, such as the fall of a democracy in the midst of inequality and corruption or the never-ending guilt a small boy from a desert planet puts himself through after he is freed from the destructive cycle of his community, yet his mother is left behind. The ultimate failings of the prequels is in the cheesy dialogue and horribly drawn out scenes. We've seen before that the prequels can be fleshed out and developed into compelling storylines with The Clone Wars and prequel comics. The prequels have a fascinating story to tell, and one relevant to today. They deserve a second chance. Plus, we can add more space lasers (pew pew).\nI love it.\n*\tWe are taking a break from surveys this week, but we will return with one next week.

{"prompt": "This Week (3.22.2020)##SEPERATION##", "completion": "Salutations, esteemed learners.\nLast week, as we were engaging in the unknown that was (and continues to be) the start of T3, I took a break and opened The Campitor on my computer.  I read through the articles, enjoying both the serious and sardonic  pieces, when I came to page 6, and I perused a review of The Good Place.  Over the past several years, I’ve slid in and out of watching the television series, so I was curious about Claire Ferris’s take.  Unsurprisingly, she provided an insightful examination, arriving at a singular question, one which I will misquote slightly, because it is incredibly relevant now: what do we owe each other?\nClaire posits that all of us will have slightly different answers, and I agree.  However, during this spring of COVID-19, I suspect that all of us will have similar response: we owe each other support, understanding, compassion, humor, and patience--and that’s just to start.\nIn the interest of support, this week, we will continue the experiment of full immersive virtual learning.  I’ve already received feedback from teachers and some students: if we continue this grand experiment past March 27th, we will look at ways to create “passing” time between classes; we will consider how we can change the number of classes per day; and we will work to create low-stress meetings for advisory.  Clubs will also be on the table as a means of ensuring community.\nI invite you to email me by Monday at noon if you want us to consider other ways to revise the schedule, all with an eye toward building support for each other.\nAs we look at other aspects of the school year, please know that Mrs. Holland will be reaching out tomorrow with a revised—and low stress—plan to let you know about classes for next year, along with a plan to sign up for courses.\nFor those of you concerned about AP tests, on Friday the College Board released their revisions for this year’s tests.  You can see the site yourself, but here are the highlights:\n1.\tAll AP tests will be virtual.  The dates will be determined, but there should be some flexibility.\n2.\tAll AP tests (except for certain portfolio versions) will be 45-minutes long.  Yes, you read that correctly: 45-minutes long.  The types of questions will be announced by April 3rd.\n3.\tAll AP tests will test on material covered during the first 2/3 of a typical AP class.  The material that would typically be covered during March, April, and May will not appear on the test.\nSee the College Board website for more details.\nOn Wednesday, Dr. Ehrhardt will announce our plans for the following weeks.  If we are going to continue virtual classes, we will send out the revised schedule at that time.  In the meantime, continue to consider how we can help each other, to further paraphrase Claire’s question.\nToward that end, I leave you with a piece from that Meme Maestro, Alexandra Ellison.\nStay healthy, and keep your sense of humor.\nRobin Follet\nHead of Upper School\nCARY ACADEMY\n1500 N.

Teachers may assign a task for classwork (including a virtual meeting) and a standard homework assignment may also be assigned for that class.\n*\tWe will alternate between Monday and Tuesday classes. This week, Monday classes will take place on Wednesday and Friday.  Tuesday classes will take place on Thursday.\n*\tTo coordinate the use of online tools for virtual class meetings, and to coordinate teacher availability for questions, all teachers and students will follow our “Virtual Day Schedule.”  All teachers and students are asked to be online and engaged for their classes with the following schedule:\nA             12:00 - 12:30\nB             12:30 – 1:00\nC            1:00 - 1:30\nD            1:30 - 2:00\nE             2:00 – 2:30\nF             2:30 – 3:00\nG            3:00 – 3:30\nThe faculty and staff have already offered several excellent ideas for modifications to this schedule.  However, for the sake of simplicity and clarity, we will run this schedule until March 27th.  If need be, we can revise and improve the virtual schedule should our virtual days continue after the 27th.  And, of course, if you have any suggestions, please feel free to send them to me.\nOther assorted items\nMs. Holland and I will be working out the details of course registration.

The team worked on theoretical and experimental physics of the rainbows formed by liquids other than water.  Their experimental work stood out among all the teams at this extraordinarily rigorous international competition as the only group that was able to design and build an apparatus that confined the phenomenon to the lab where all relevant variables could be studied in a controlled experiment.  Several other teams and coaches commented on how they were amazed at the  unique way that this team approached and solved the problem.   Following the competition, this team didn’t stop, as they presented their results to students in the Waves, Electricity and Light classes who were studying rainbows for their independent project.

{"prompt": "This Week (9.30.18)##SEPERATION##", "completion": "Salutations, esteemed Chargers.\nAs we charge into the second half of Trimester One, I wanted to share a quick update with you.  Over the past weeks, a number of students have spoken to me and other adults about their challenges involving access to homework and homework calendars.  With those concerns in mind, I polled the faculty for their thoughts and ideas.  As you can imagine, with all the insightful members of the community, I received a number of suggestions.  More importantly, through the help of faculty and students, I was able to clarify the strands of the dilemma, which can be simplified to two questions that students face: do I have homework?  Where can I find my homework?\nWe are looking at long-term solutions, but for the short-term, I am borrowing the suggestions of several faculty, who offered that we can best address that first question easily: in addition to listing homework on the current calendars, teachers will write the homework on the board and verbally announce the homework in class.  That way, you will receive a visual and aural reminder of your assignments each day.\nIn the coming months, we will look at ways to better address both of the key questions.\nNow, on to other matters.\nSchedule items\n*\tTomorrow, our Grade Level Leaders and Lead Advisors will be at an advisory retreat.

As we look ahead to conferences next week, please take some time during classes in the coming days to reflect  on the class and prepare good talking points for your conference. Remember, the conferences are STUDENT-LED, meaning your voice will be heard most! Later this week, I will send an email to your parents instructing them on how to schedule conferences.\n*\tOn Tuesday, October 2nd we will enjoy the Fall Tailgate.  Please come out and support your classmates.  For more information, see Lindsay Callihan’s email.

Seven students, two alumni, and a faculty member offered their insights into curiosity, discussing everything from moving beyond selfie tourism to the importance of diverse opinions and abilities in STEM (and life), from reflections on teaching powerfully to reflections on the power of entrepreneurship to help others.  Kudos, too, for the faculty, staff, and students who worked behind the scenes to ensure this successful event.\nFor this week, we offer you a lovely cornucopia of exciting options and opportunities.\nOn Tuesday, the entire Upper School will come to the Theater for a Town Hall, which will start at 2:45.\nOn Wednesday evening, from 7:00-8:30, juniors and their parents will participate in the Junior College Night, also in the Theater.\nThe US Math Department has two announcements:\nAnnouncement #1\nMath problem of the week! Each week there will posted a new “problem of the week” on the whiteboard wall of the math wing. This problem will require only general math knowledge and is open to all students to attempt. How can you play? Either you or some of your friends (Limit 4 group members) should use the whiteboard wall to work out your solution, then take a picture of it , and send it to Mr. Noland. If you are correct you, and your team members, will be entered into a drawing for some fabulous prizes that will be held at the end of each trimester.

Now that we’ve had a chance to take a breath, I wanted to remind you of three important ideas for this year.\n*\tContinue to own your own learning.  Reach out to teachers when you need help; we have time in the schedule now for those conversations.  In addition, consider how you can use Flex Days to embrace the idea of charting your learning growth (and shout out to the students and faculty who went on a bike ride through Umstead this past Wednesday—hence the illustration in today’s email).\n*\tBe patient with yourself and others.  This is a hard time, all compounded by the need to social distance and the uncertainty of how long the distancing will last.  We will make mistakes.  We will accomplish wonderous things.  Be patient.\n*\tFinally, take that patience and be proactive: find opportunities for kindness and connection.  There’s enough ugliness in the world right now; we can shine not only academically, but also socially and emotionally.  How can you support others?  Think about the kind words and actions you can offer.\nNow, here are all the important details.\nThis Week’s Schedule\n*\tThis week, we will not have our Wednesday Flex Day, since we have a shortened, four-day week courtesy of Labor Day.\n*\tTuesday is a Monday Schedule\n*\tWednesday is a Tuesday schedule\n*\tThursday is a Thursday\n*\tFriday is a Friday\nCollege Visits at CA\nZoom meeting links for each visit are located in SCOIR under "Meeting Link."
