Salutations, esteemed Chargers.
As we charge into the second half of Trimester One, I wanted to share a quick update with you.  Over the past weeks, a number of students have spoken to me and other adults about their challenges involving access to homework and homework calendars.  With those concerns in mind, I polled the faculty for their thoughts and ideas.  As you can imagine, with all the insightful members of the community, I received a number of suggestions.  More importantly, through the help of faculty and students, I was able to clarify the strands of the dilemma, which can be simplified to two questions that students face: do I have homework?  Where can I find my homework?
We are looking at long-term solutions, but for the short-term, I am borrowing the suggestions of several faculty, who offered that we can best address that first question easily: in addition to listing homework on the current calendars, teachers will write the homework on the board and verbally announce the homework in class.  That way, you will receive a visual and aural reminder of your assignments each day.
In the coming months, we will look at ways to better address both of the key questions.
Now, on to other matters.
