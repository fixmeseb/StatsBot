Salutations, esteemed learners.
As we head into the second week of T2, enjoy a second week of normality, which will allow us to prep for Spirit Week and Homecoming before the holiday break.
On an unrelated note, please remember that academics take precedence over sports practices.  Your coaches will understand if you are a few minutes late, provided you have been receiving the extra help you need for your classes.
Enjoy the time as we ease fully into December.
For the details of this week, see below.
This Week’s Schedule
Normal!
On Tuesday, we will revel in a Town Hall during Advisory time.
On Thursday, you can enjoy a dance performance.  See the calendar for details.
