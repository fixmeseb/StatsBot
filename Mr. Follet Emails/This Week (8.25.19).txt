Good afternoon, esteemed learners.
This week, we will enjoy classes on Monday and Tuesday, followed by class trips Wednesday through Friday.
On Monday afternoon, we will experience the Club Fair in all of its enticing glory.
On Tuesday, wear your spiffiest clothes, as we will have our yearbook pictures taken in world language classes.
I offer two reminders: in general, during your lunches, please eschew the choice of bringing your bookbags into the Dining Hall.  We want to avoid students inadvertently knocking food from each otherâ€™s hands simply by turning; bookbags make unfortunately effective food-flingers.  As well, make sure that you clean up after yourself, whether you are eating inside or outside.  You should return all plates, cups, bowls, and silverware to the dining hall.
Here are the important dates for the next few weeks.
8/26      Club Fair
8/26      Senior College Night
8/27      US Photos taken during World Language classes.
8/28-30  US class trips
9/2        No school
9/27      No homework weekend and Friday Night Lights
9/30      No school
Enjoy this week and the coming long weekend!
Regards,
Mr. Follet
