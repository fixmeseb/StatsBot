Esteemed learners,
Welcome to the end of the trimester.  After our noon dismissal on Friday, make sure that you take time to relax and recharge.  As a precursor to that opportunity, consider coming to the annual StuCo Glow Stick Dance this Thursday.
Have a good final week of Trimester 1!
Mr. Follet
