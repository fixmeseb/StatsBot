Welcome back, esteemed learners.
I hope that you had a chance to recharge this weekend, especially after an exciting start to the weekend courtesy of all involved with Friday Night Lights.
This Week
We will start Tuesday following a normal Tuesday schedule after the long no-homework weekend.  Otherwise, we should have a normal set of four days to start October.  See the upcoming dates at the end of this email regarding the next few weeks and the associated days off.
Midterm reports will be available for your viewing later this week.  As we look ahead to conferences in two weeks, please take some time during classes in the coming days to reflect  on the class and prepare good talking points for your conference. Remember, the conferences are STUDENT-LED, meaning your voice will be heard most! In the next week, I will send an email to your parents instructing them on how to schedule conferences.
Kudos
Bravo to all the community members who made Friday Night Lights happen, whether you were playing, coaching, dancing, serving, or planning.  Thank you!
