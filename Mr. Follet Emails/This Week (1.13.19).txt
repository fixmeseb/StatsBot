Salutations, Chargers.
We will enjoy a busy week, beginning on Monday with the Triangle Diversity Alliance taking place on Cary Academy’s campus.  Approximately two hundred students from CA and other local schools will be participating in and leading various workshops around campus.  If you are participating in the conference, I look forward to hearing about your discussions.
We will end the week with our MLK speaker.  More information should be coming out shortly, though you can view the altered schedule online.
And just a reminder: we will have no school on Monday, January 21st in honor of the MLK Holiday.
Have a lovely week!
