Salutations, esteemed students.
This week, we will enjoy a spirited week leading up to Homecoming on Friday (and pre-homecoming on Thursday for our wrestlers).
Keep an eye out for all the activities that will allow you to show support for your various communities.
This Week
Monday: Missed my Alarm Monday
Tuesday: Time Travel Tuesday.  Also, enjoy hot chocolate and doughnuts, courtesy of the PTAA.
Wednesday: Meme Day
Thursday: Wacky Thursday, with a slightly altered schedule that allows for Wacky Olympics.
Friday: Extreme Blue and Gold Day, with a slightly altered schedule that allows for the Pep Rally at the end of the day.
