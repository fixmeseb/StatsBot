Esteemed chargers,
Kudos for a fantastic first week of Trimester 2.  The start of any trimester brings its own excitement, so when we add the Holiday Shoppe, thousands of visitors to campus, and adventures in parking, life becomes even more exhilarating on campus.  As a reward for successfully navigating the busy first five days of T2, we will bask in the calmness of a relatively quiet second week.  Don’t worry, though; the exuberance returns with Spirit Week, beginning on December 10th.
This Week’s Schedule
*	Enjoy a normal set of class days and a normal slate of class expectations.
*	On Tuesday, because of an Upper School Open House, we will need student drivers to park on Fire Drill Hill or by the tennis courts.
*	On Wednesday, because of a Middle School Open House, we will need students drivers to park on Fire Drill Hill or by the tennis courts.
*	On Friday, Add/Drop for T2 will end.  Please submit any requests for class changes to Ms. Holland by this day.
Kudos
