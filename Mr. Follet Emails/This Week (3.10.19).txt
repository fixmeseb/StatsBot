Salutations, esteemed students.
Welcome to Trimester Three!  I hope you enjoyed your break, finding time to rest and unplug.  The next several months will pass quickly, especially as we begin to look toward next year and the exciting class options.
First, though, we have a busy week, one that includes a guest speaker (and an altered schedule) on Tuesday, and the US Variety Show on Friday.
Please pay attention to the changes for this trimester, including classroom locations.
Now, the details.
This week
Monday: Welcome to the start of the trimester.
Tuesday: We will run an altered schedule; Dr. Wilkie Wilson will be a guest speaker today.
Wednesday: Enjoy a normal schedule.
Thursday: Due to a parent coffee, student drivers may need to park in an alternate location.  More details will be forthcoming.
Friday: Due to another parent coffee, student drivers may need to park in a different locale.  We will send more details shortly.  As well, we will enjoy the US Talent Show this evening.
The newness
1.	New classrooms.  If you take a science class or a course with Ms. MacDonald, then your classroom has moved to the new science building.  Check your schedule to see the new location.
2.	With a new trimester comes new PATH courses, PE options, and art classes.  Please check your schedules for any changes.
3.	After two decades of wear, the furniture in the lunchroom needed to be updated.  Enjoy.
4.	We will be piloting a trial program for 9s.  Rather than placing you in study halls during your third trimester, we will give you a free period, the same privileges as students in the other grades.  However, please remember to sign in at the US office at the start of the day and immediately after lunch; all other grades have the same obligation.
5.	Please take care of the spaces on campus—both the old and the new.
