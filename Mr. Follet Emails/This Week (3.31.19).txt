Salutations, esteemed students.
Welcome back after the long-ish weekend; I hope you had a chance to enjoy the beautiful weather.  This week, you will be working with your advisors, selecting courses for next year.  Remember, courses are NOT first come, first served.
At the end of the week, please join the community for Friday Night Lights!
Regards,
Mr. Follet
