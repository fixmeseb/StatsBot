Salutations, esteemed students.
Kudos on a spirited five days this past week; as always, you demonstrated your creativity and inventiveness.  Bravo to the 12s, who took first place in the Halloween Spirt Week contest, followed by the 9s, who eked out second place over the 10s.   We are all looking forward to the Fall Festival this coming Wednesday, complete with decorated porches.
When you have a moment, peruse the Sage lunch menu for the coming two weeks.  You’ll notice that Chef Sam is truly bringing back your favorites.  To accommodate the projected increased interest in hot food,  all four serving lines will provide the hot option. The two lines that normally serve cold food with also have salads.  And rest assured: if you are in the Gold Cohort, and you are heartbroken about missing pizza on Tuesday, 10/27, simply look forward to Friday, 11/6, reveling in the knowledge that all the pizza will be yours!
Now, for the quotidian details:
