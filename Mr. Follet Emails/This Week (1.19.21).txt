Salutations, esteemed learners.
I hope that you’ve had a good weekend.  Even if circumstances haven’t been ideal for volunteering in honor of the day, Dr. Glaude gave us quite a bit to consider about Dr. King’s legacy, courtesy of the MLK day presentation.  Thanks again to Ms. Johnson-Webb and the CCE for arranging that wonderful talk.
Due to the MLK holiday, we will start classes on Tuesday this week.
Schedule this week:
*	Tuesday:            Blue Cohort follows a Monday schedule
*	Wednesday:     Blue Cohort follows a Tuesday schedule
*	Thursday:          Gold Cohort follows a Thursday schedule
*	Friday:                Gold Cohort follows a Friday schedule
I offer you two reminders:
*	Add/Drop is over.
*	Please continue to be mindful of the three Ws: wash (your hands frequently), wear (a mask), and wait (six feet from others).  Here’s the link to the CA Compact page, which outlines all the detail about how to stay healthy in these times: CA guidelines <https://united.cary.academy/health-well-being/campus-guidelines/>
