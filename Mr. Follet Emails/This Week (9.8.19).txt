Salutations, esteemed students.
We will enjoy a full week of classes this week, ending with the excitement of Fall Tailgate.  Please come out and cheer on your classmates this Friday during all the athletic contests.
During the week, please make sure that you clean up after yourselves after lunch.  Take your plates, cups, bowls, and silverware back to the dining hall; avoid leaving dining detritus for others to pick up.  As well, remember that you may eat in the dining hall and on the quad.  Other buildings are not lunch locations.
Have a good week!
Mr. Follet
