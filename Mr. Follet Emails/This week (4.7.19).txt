Salutations, esteemed students.
At the end of this week, we will arrive at the midterm for T3.  Appropriately enough, Funfest should take place at that point, weather permitting.  And then the juniors and seniors have the joy of prom on Saturday.  As we move into the last portion of the school year, continue to make good decisions, both inside and outside the classroom.
Now, the details…
This Week
Monday:  We will experience a normal Monday.
Tuesday: Due to the number of MS and US games on campus on April 9th, no students should park by the tennis courts or lower fields.  You may park on Fire Drill Hill.  As well, no student may drive a car to the lower campus at the end of school.
Wednesday:  We will run a slightly altered schedule, one that will offer a soft opening for lunch, as well as build fifteen minutes into the end of the day for academic or community time.  We will be reaching out for your input.  See the calendar for more details.
Thursday:  Normal-ish.
Friday:  Juniors may need to park on the hill. Look for an announcement from Mrs. Eason.  Friday is also the T3 midterm.
