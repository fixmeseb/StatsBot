Esteemed students,
I hope that you enjoyed both the class trips and the Labor Day weekend.  From all I’ve heard about the trips, you comported yourselves with respect, earning accolades from your chaperones and other adults.
This week, we begin hosting college visits, an opportunity for juniors and seniors.  Clubs start their meetings as well.  See below for details.
Welcome to September, and enjoy this shortened week.  And yes—we are keeping an eye on the weather.
Regards,
Mr. Follet
Schedule
On Tuesday, we start the week following the normal TUESDAY schedule.

College Visits
We offer these reminders about college visits:
1.                 If you will miss any portion of a class you must ask permission of the teacher to attend the college visit PRIOR to the class.  The decision will be left up to each teacher as to whether you can miss class time.
2.                 All college visitors will meet in the Conference Room (U200) unless otherwise designated.
3.                 Tablets may be used with permission of the college visitor.
4.                 Make sure you come with questions to ask the college representative.
5.                As always, food and drink are not allowed in the Conference Room.
