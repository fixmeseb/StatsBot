Salutations, esteemed students.
I hope that the first few days back from break have treated you well.  January will be enjoyably busy, but we have a relatively calm week for the next five days.
I offer a few reminders.  If you are a sophomore and you drive to school, please remember to park by the tennis courts.  If you are a junior driver, please pay attention to the parking rotation.  Should it be your turn to park by the tennis courts, then please park by the tennis courts.  As well, all student drivers should remember that you may only go into the parking lot during the day if you’ve checked in with the US office first.
We will have the US Semi-Formal Dance in slightly less than three weeks.  If you are planning to attend, and you want to bring a non-CA guest, you must provide the following to Mrs. Maret Jones or Mrs. Eason before the dance: the guest’s name, the name of the guest’s parent or guardian, and a phone number for the parent or guardian.
This Monday, we have the Junior College Night for Juniors and parents.  Otherwise, we should have a normal week.
