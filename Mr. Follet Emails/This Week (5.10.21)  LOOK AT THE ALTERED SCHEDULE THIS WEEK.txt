Salutations, esteemed learners.
Welcome to the last full week of classes.  Of course, we will have Graduation Week and Discovery Term, but the year is winding down.
Remember, this week, we are running an altered schedule: on Wednesday, WE WILL HAVE THURSDAY CLASSES, SO YOU SHOULD BE IN SCHOOL.  On Thursday, we will have our Flex Day.  For those of you with siblings in the Middle School, please know that they will have a normal schedule this week.
For a quick snapshot of Graduation Week, please see the attached PDF.
Finally, this week, courtesy of the PTAA, enjoy a Sunset Slush on May 11th from 2:10-3:30pm.  Sunset Slush (frozen flavored ice treats) is bringing 3 push carts with umbrellas to set up on the pathway by the Quad/FC.
Now, for the additional details:
Dress Code
Please follow it.  If you have questions, ask a dean.  Not sure where to read about the Dress Code?  Look for “US Handbook” under Resources in your Blackbaud portal, and then search the handbook for the dress code.
Lunch
Clean up after yourselves.  Clean up after your friends.  Keep the campus clean.  As well, please continue to follow the safety protocols, for your health and the health of the community.  Keep safe distances, and when you are not eating, make sure that you are wearing your masks.
COVID testing
Want or need to take a COVID test?  CA provides that opportunity.  All students are eligible. Testing is from 2:30pm to 5:30pm Tuesdays in the Dining Hall.
