Salutations, esteemed learners.
As we roll into the second half of the trimester, continue to focus on finding balance.  Yes, we want you to succeed in academics—hence the opportunity to reflect on your learning with your parents and your teachers during conferences.  And we also want you to enjoy extracurriculars (and enjoy the support of peers, teachers, and staff as you pursue those co-curricular opportunities, which is why we value the Fall Tailgate).  Just as importantly, though, make sure you take a few moments to relax, using the belly breaths that you learned about (or will learn about) in Emotional Health.  And remember—if you need a quiet place, consider the Zen Den, open on non-Emo Health days.
Now, the details of the week.
Schedule
*	Monday is a Monday schedule.
*	Tuesday is a Tuesday schedule.  We will be running a blood drive as well.
*	Wednesday has no classes.
*	 Instead, the 9th grade will enjoy special programming in the Theater pertaining to wellness.
*	The 10th and 11th grades will bask in the joy of standardized tests, courtesy of the PSATs.  Please report to the Upper School.
*	  The 12th grade will consume their senior breakfast and then spend the remainder of the morning working on college applications, aided by the college counseling office and members of the English Department.  Please go to the math wing of the Center for Math and Science.  Indeed, don’t go to the science wing, since it’s still under construction, and you are not allowed to be there.
*	If you need to stay on campus after the noon dismissal for your conferences, you may enjoy lunch in the Dining Hall.
*	On Wednesday, conferences will start at 1:20 and run to 8:00.  These discussions allow you to take ownership of your learning, so please come to each conference prepared to discuss what is going well in the class, and what you plan to work on.
*	On Thursday, conferences will run from 8:00 a.m. to noon.
*	On Friday, we will have no school.
