Salutations, esteemed learners.
This week, when you have your advisories face-to-face, we will ask that you complete the High Achieving Schools Survey, a tool that will provide us an excellent snapshot of your areas of success and stress at Cary Academy.  For that reason, please bring your computers to advisory.
Also, remember that we are running an altered schedule this week: on Wednesday, we will run the Thursday Gold Cohort schedule, and on Thursday, we will run our Friday Gold Cohort schedule.  Friday will be a half-day Flex day.
Afterwards, make sure you enjoy your two-week break.
