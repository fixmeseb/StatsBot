Salutations, esteemed learners.
It’s been a long semester, and while it’s not quite over, please enjoy the two-week Thanksgiving break after this week.  Stay healthy, enjoy some down time, eat good food.
Before we get to break, though, we will follow an altered schedule this week:
o   Monday, 11/9:                Follow a Blue Cohort Monday schedule
o   Tuesday, 11/10:              Follow a Blue Cohort Tuesday schedule
o   Wednesday, 11/11:        Follow a Gold Cohort Thursday schedule
o   Thursday,11/12:              Follow a Gold Cohort Friday schedule
o   Friday, 11/13:                 Half day Flex Day before Thanksgiving Break.  See Dr. McElreath’s email regarding the Veterans Day virtual event on this day.
Just a reminder: there will be no Upper School lunch on Friday.
Kudos
*	This weekend Natasha Sachar and Julia Young led the very first Charger Model UN (Virtual) Conference. It took an incredible amount of work, with students participating from 5 other schools.
*	Additionally, we had award winners from CA:
*        Best Delegate: Casey Powell (Russia), Abby Smetana (China)
*        Honorable Mention: Dena Levin (Israel)
*	Teja Wasudev and Emma Esposito also chaired a UN Committee as sophomores.
Scientific Request
On a fun scientific note, Science Olympiad is collecting bottle caps.  After you finish slurping your water at lunch, please consider donating your bottle caps to the scientific cause.  Look for the “obnoxious green containers” in both the CMS and Upper School, to quote Mrs. Burnett.
