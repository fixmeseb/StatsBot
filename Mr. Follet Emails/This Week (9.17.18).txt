Salutations, students.
Given the wind and rain over the past few days, I hope that you’ve been safe.  The remnants of Hurricane Florence continue to affect our region, so I wasn’t surprised when I heard from members of the 10th grade class, inquiring about ways that we can help others who were more directly impacted.  Please look for more information soon.
Schedule items
Remember, this week students do not have classes on Wednesday September 19th, which will be a faculty and staff professional development day.  As a result, we will switch our Friday schedule, running a Wednesday slate of classes on Friday, September 21st.
Also, have you ever wanted to ask The Administration a question or offer your opinion (politely phrased, of course), but you didn’t want to walk into the US Office?  I will hold an open forum for student questions and feedback on Thursday, September 27th in U201 during Community Time.  Feel free to stop by.
Shout outs
Kudos to the CERT club; those students, led by Mr. Wacenske, ensured that many of the loose items around our campus were stored in safe locations prior to Florence’s arrival.  On a related note, if you have a free period on Monday during A or B Blocks, please consider helping to move the outdoor patio furniture from the FC lobby to the correct locations, weather permitting.
Mr. Noland let me know of the following winners for the Week 2 math contest:
*	Team: Harrison Truscott, Obinna Modilim, Tommy Frank, Loren Troan
*	David Go
*	Team: Peyton Gozon, Nathan Mitten
*	Emily Wang
