Salutations, esteemed students.
This week, once again you will have the opportunity to embrace your learning inside and outside the classroom: inside, because that’s what we do at Cary Academy; outside, because the election provides us with a chance to practice our Statement of Community Values.
No matter who ultimately wins or loses the election, some of us will be thrilled with the election outcome.  Some will be upset.  Some will be scared. Please consider our community as you process your feelings—that was, after all, the essence of our dialogs over the past few weeks.
Thank you in advance for embracing respect, integrity, and compassion in all of our interactions, especially this week.
As well, kudos for the Halloween Porches.  As I stared out of my office window, I watched each grade create something from a collection of interesting, odd, and sometimes scary items.  Nicely done practicing your design skills.
Finally, I want to offer a final shout out to our fall athletes.  Congratulations on playing through a strange season, one that we weren’t sure would exist.
Now, for the routine (yet important) details.
