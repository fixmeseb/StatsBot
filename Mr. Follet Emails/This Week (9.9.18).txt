Salutations, esteemed students.
Before I launch into all the fun for the week, I want to congratulate all those CA community members involved in the TEDx talks on Friday.  Seven students, two alumni, and a faculty member offered their insights into curiosity, discussing everything from moving beyond selfie tourism to the importance of diverse opinions and abilities in STEM (and life), from reflections on teaching powerfully to reflections on the power of entrepreneurship to help others.  Kudos, too, for the faculty, staff, and students who worked behind the scenes to ensure this successful event.
For this week, we offer you a lovely cornucopia of exciting options and opportunities.
On Tuesday, the entire Upper School will come to the Theater for a Town Hall, which will start at 2:45.
On Wednesday evening, from 7:00-8:30, juniors and their parents will participate in the Junior College Night, also in the Theater.
The US Math Department has two announcements:
Announcement #1
Math problem of the week! Each week there will posted a new “problem of the week” on the whiteboard wall of the math wing. This problem will require only general math knowledge and is open to all students to attempt. How can you play? Either you or some of your friends (Limit 4 group members) should use the whiteboard wall to work out your solution, then take a picture of it , and send it to Mr. Noland. If you are correct you, and your team members, will be entered into a drawing for some fabulous prizes that will be held at the end of each trimester. Submissions are due each Friday by 3:15 and each correct submission will earn you another ticket for the end of trimester drawing.
Last week’s winner: Loren Troan
Announcement #2
Math Lab is open for the 2018-2019 school year! The math lab will be staffed with math teachers to assist you with homework problems, review your work, coordinate doing assessment corrections, or if you just need a space to get some group work done on a math related topic. It will be open during Club times on Monday, A block on Wednesdays (if you have study hall just check in with your teacher and then come over), and Club Time on Thursdays.
