Salutations, esteemed learners.
Happy last weekend of summer; I hope you’ve had a chance to enjoy the beautiful weather.
We have another full week as we work toward the midterm of T1.  If you are surprised (or nervous) by the speed of the trimester, don’t worry—we still have six weeks left.
For other details of the week, see below.
Regards,
Mr. Follet
