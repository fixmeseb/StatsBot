Salutations, esteemed students.
Given all the activity this week, I shall be brief.  Enjoy the week, especially the stressbuster activities.  As well, good luck on AP exams if you taking the tests.

This Week
*	Monday: All sophomores and juniors, please park on the hill; we have a bevy of MS games on the lower campus in the afternoon.  Also, do not drive to the lower campus in the afternoon.  However, please enjoy a morning stressbuster snack of Dunkin Donuts between 7:30 and 8:00 in the US lobby courtesy of the PTAA.  As well, please offer your good vibes on the good vibes banner.
*	Tuesday:  Continue to offer good vibes on the eponymous banner.
*	Wednesday: Snap, Crackle, and POP the Stress Out. Enjoy a Popcorn Bar and a Bubble-Wrap Pop-Off with prizes both located on patio outside FC. Or de-stress with Mindfulness with Ms. Gooding at the Flagpole.
*	Thursday:  Enjoy a normal day.
*	Friday:  Revel is a second normal day.
