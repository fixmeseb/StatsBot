Esteemed students,
As Trimester Three speeds along, we will enjoy a busy four-day week of classes.  Remember: Thursday evening and Friday will be devoted to Advisor-Advisee-Parent conferences, allowing students in grades 9-11 ample time to discuss the various classes they can take next year.
Now, for the details…
This Week
Monday: Enjoy a regular schedule.
Tuesday: We will run an altered schedule.  The NHS speaker series will take place.  We will have a Town Hall during advisory.
Wednesday: Enjoy a normal day.
Thursday: Juniors may need to park on the hill; look for possible communication from Mrs. Eason.  Advisor-Advisee-Parent conferences begin in the afternoon.
Friday: No classes.  Advisor-Advisee-Parent conferences take place.
