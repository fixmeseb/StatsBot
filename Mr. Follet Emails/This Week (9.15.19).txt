Salutations, esteemed students.
If you have a moment, please thank the X-Factor advisors and membership.  This past Wednesday, they sponsored Games on the Quad, a rousingly successful experience.  We will look at running another series of quad games soon.
Kudos go, too, to all the players and supporters at our Fall Tailgate.  Please come out to as many games as possible in the next few weeks, and don’t forget: Friday Night Lights will take place on Friday, September 27th.
Enjoy a full week of classes.
Regards,
Mr. Follet
Schedule
We will revel in another full week with no altered schedules.  However, those seniors who drive to school may have to park in an alternate location this Thursday, due to a large US parent coffee.  Look for more details soon.
