Salutations, esteemed students.
On Friday, a gunman attacked two mosques in New Zealand, killing fifty worshippers.  Even though the violence took place half a world away, it reverberates here, echoing other incidents of brutality, even from this year.  As I wrote almost six months ago, please continue to support each other, especially those of us who are hurting because of violence visited on our larger communities.  Share--in language verbal and nonverbal--how much all of us belong here.
In more quotidian events, this week, we will begin to focus on the coming year, starting with the Course Registration assembly for 9th-11th grade students and the Transition to College assembly for 12th graders.  Various adults will provide guidance, answer questions, and offer opportunities for discussions, whether you are a rising sophomore thinking about a science class, or a graduating senior thinking about life outside of Cary Academy.
See below for more weekly details.
This Week
*	Monday: 11th and 12th grade students park on the hill.  The 8th grade parents will be using the US lot in the afternoon.
*	Tuesday: we will run an altered schedule.  In the afternoon, the 9th-11th grade students will have the Course Registration Assembly.  The 12th grade students will have a transition to college program with Mr. Wacenske.
*	Wednesday and Thursday: we will experience normality for a few days.
*	Friday: because of the STEP conference, we may ask juniors, and possibly seniors, to park on the hill.  Also ADD-DROP ends this Friday.
Kudos
*	Congratulations to HOSA, who attended the State Leadership Conference in Charlotte over break.  All fifteen of our students acquitted themselves beautifully, with eleven of them placing in the top ten in their respective categories.  Eric Wang placed first in his category of Epidemiology; Liya Chen placed third in her category of Pharmacology.  As a result, both qualify for the International Leadership Conference.
*	Kudos, too, to Mrs. Nix, Mr. Pellicciotta, and the debate team for a successful inaugural Triangle Debate League tournament.
*	This past Friday at the Music Performance Adjudication, the CA Singers received the highest rating of superior from all of the adjudicators, including a perfect score in the ever daunting sight reading category.
*	And finally, bravo to all of our winter sports athletes!
