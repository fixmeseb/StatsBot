Esteemed students and faculty,
Happy traveling, work experiencing, and discovery terming!  Kudos on an excellent school year; now, enjoy the last two weeks, for which I offer you just a few details below.
Regards,
Mr. Follet
*	Schedules for next year
*	Mrs. Holland is in the process of revising schedules now.  Over the next few weeks, she will reach out to students whose schedules need some tweaking.
*	DT location reminders:
*	Stay on campus.  You may not leave CA unless you are on a field trip, or you have been signed out by a parent.
*	Stay within bounds on campus.  You may be on the quad and in the buildings facing the quad. You may not go to the Middle School unless you have checked in with the US office first.  You may not venture down to the track or beyond.
*	Kudos
*	At the Upper School End of Year Celebration, we inadvertently missed sharing the accomplishments of Paul Ibrahim, Jay Sagrolikar, Allen He, and Oliver Want, though I was able to announce their names.
*	Below, I offer a summary of their accomplishments and the reason they won a mission award for collaboration.
*	This team of USA Young Physicists Team members worked on an extraterrestrial rainbow problem for one school year.  The team worked on theoretical and experimental physics of the rainbows formed by liquids other than water.  Their experimental work stood out among all the teams at this extraordinarily rigorous international competition as the only group that was able to design and build an apparatus that confined the phenomenon to the lab where all relevant variables could be studied in a controlled experiment.  Several other teams and coaches commented on how they were amazed at the  unique way that this team approached and solved the problem.   Following the competition, this team didn’t stop, as they presented their results to students in the Waves, Electricity and Light classes who were studying rainbows for their independent project.    Whenever asked, they made the time to meet with another group of students, and ended up giving their presentation multiple times.  For their outstanding collaboration among themselves while solving their problem and with other students at CA, as well as their innovative approach using polymer spheres to make macro-raindrops, we nominate them for the innovation and collaboration awards.
*	Mr. Noland offered the following message regarding the problem of the week:
*	“All students who during T1 or T2, submitted two or more correct answers to a Problem of the Week were entered into a weighted drawing based on the number of correct problems each student solved. Four students earned a commemorative pin for their efforts:  Owen Kadis, Nathan Mitten, Brian Wei and Colin Zhu. The grand prize winner was Jono Jenkens, who won a special T-shirt that I hope he will display proudly.
*	“The other students who earned a place in the raffle were: Peyton Gozon, Marvin Koonce, Andrew Lake, Elizabeth Maydew, Emily Wang and Kailey Wrege.
*	“Thanks to everyone who participated this year, and let’s keep this going next year too!”
