Salutations, esteemed learners.
*	Congrats to StuCo for the successful edition of Family Feud, CA style.  Kudos to both teams: Team Red Dawn, with Mr. Lasseter, Dr. Meszaros, Mrs. Burnett, and Ms. Toreson; and Team Marvin, with Marvin Koonce, Dena Levin, Samantha Lattanze, and Talia Ginsberg.  Missed the fun?  Watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufDyfa5s5HI
*	This week, I offer a shout out to the  Film Club. The leaders have shared that they are watching Rio Bravo on Flex Day; consider joining them.  Some of the other films that they enjoyed?  WarGames, Sunset Boulevard, Hunt for the Wilderpeople, La La Land, and the Indiana Jones franchise.
*	Sarah Zhao offers the following: “workers have been courageously making sacrifices to keep us safe and healthy, despite the many obstacles they face. You can help boost morale by spreading positivity and love this Valentine’s Day! Come by the US lobby this week of Feb. 8th to write a sticky-note of appreciation for our healthcare heroes at UNC REX Hospital.”
*	As a reminder, for the health of the community, follow the three Ws: wash, wear, wait.
*	 And especially this winter, if you eat inside, please limit the number of people at tables.  We want you (and everyone in the community) to stay healthy.
*	Also, if you are staying home due to illness, medical, etc. and will be doing school virtually, please have a parent notify attendance@caryacademy.org <mailto:attendance@caryacademy.org> .
