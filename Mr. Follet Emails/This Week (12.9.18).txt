Salutations, esteemed students.
Happy snow day Monday!  And even though we won’t have classes tomorrow, we will still enjoy Spirit Week Tuesday through Friday.  I’ve included the altered spirit-wear schedule below.  Don’t forget about Penny Wars and the Food Drive as well.
For now, enjoy the day off, and stay warm.
This Week’s Schedule
Tuesday: PJ Day – “I missed my alarm!"
Wednesday: Twin, Triple, multiple Day
Thursday: Wacky Tacky Day
Friday: Extreme Spirit Day
Friday evening, 9:30-11:00: the 2018 Homecoming Party.  If you want to bring a non-CA guest, please contact Mrs. Eason or Mrs. Maret Jones for the protocol.
