Dear students,
On Friday, I had the pleasure of announcing the missions awards, all of them centered around our values as a school.  It’s a time that I love, because I know that these awards are just a sampling of how you embrace respect, integrity, compassion, discovery, innovation, collaboration, and excellence in your everyday lives.
And then yesterday, like many of you, I watched events unfold after George Floyd’s killing and the subsequent protests.  Seeing that horror, one so emblematic of the experiences of minority communities, but especially of the African American community, I kept returning to one line that I read on Friday about this year’s Overton Scholarship recipient, a fellow student who offers kindness to all but also  “speaks her truth loudly and clearly.”
And I remembered our Service Award winner, a student who decided to put others’ needs in front of his comfort.
And I remember a Community Award winner, a student who joyfully encourages others, both in word and deed.
Yes, you are becoming scientists and writers and historians and artists and thinkers and polyglots and mathematicians.  But more importantly, from what I’ve seen over this year and through the words of your peers and teachers, you are becoming agents of improvement.   You are watching out for community, and you understand that “community” extends far beyond the roll sheet of who is in your grade, or who is associated with Cary Academy.  And goodness knows, we need agents of improvement now.
I started the year by asking you to be kind to yourselves and each other.  I end the year with a corollary request: be kind to others, listen to those who are speaking their truths, and continue to make changes for the betterment of our community.
Now, regarding the quotidian details of our final week:
Monday:             Graduated seniors return their tablets and cleanout lockers.  See Mr. Jones’s email regarding the details.
Tuesday:             9th and 10th graders clean out lockers and return uniforms.
Wednesday:       11th graders clean out lockers and return uniforms.
Thursday:           Last day of synchronous classes
Friday:                 Last day.  The graduated seniors will also pick up their yearbooks from 11:30-1.
Saturday:            Students in grades 9-11 can pick up yearbooks from 10:00-11:30.
Have a good, safe week and summer.  I can’t wait to see you in person soon.
Regards,
Mr. Follet
