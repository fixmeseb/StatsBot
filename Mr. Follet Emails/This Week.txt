Esteemed students:
Welcome to the first full week of classes.  Thank you for an exciting start to the school year—your energy is infectious.  And we will follow normal schedules this week, so the energy should continue.
I offer a few reminders:
We will have Club Fair on Friday.  Please see Dr. McElreath’s email, sent on August 15th, for more details.
Drop/Add continues through August 29th.  If you have questions about your schedule, please talk to Ms. Holland.
Several students have reported that their styluses (styli?) have gone missing.  Keep an eye on your computers in particular and your possessions in general.  On a related note, see Mrs. Sengelmann in the US Office if you desire to use a locker this year.
Mr. O’Neill has also asked me to relate the following message.  During Club and Community times on Thursdays, the TV Studio (A210), Edit Suites (A201), Recording Studio (A209) and Control Room (A203) are all closed, and he will not be available to support US students at that time, as he will be working with his MS students. This will be for the entire school year.
Junior and seniors, if you want to meet with representatives from the various colleges who are on CA’s campus, please consider these reminders:
*	If you will miss any portion of a class you must ask permission of the teacher to attend the college visit PRIOR to the class. The decision will be left up to each teacher as to whether you can miss class time.
*	All college visitors will meet in the Conference Room (U200) unless otherwise designated.
*	Tablets may be used with permission of the college visitor.
*	Make sure you come with questions to ask the college representative.
*	As always, food and drink are not allowed in the Conference Room
I offer you a few more important dates:
8/23                     US Meet the Teacher Night (for US parents)
