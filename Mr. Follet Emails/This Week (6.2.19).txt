Salutations, esteemed students.
As this week comes to a close, I hope you continue to enjoy your adventures, whether you are traveling abroad, working with local professionals, or exploring an intriguing class.  And though it probably does not need to be written, I offer you this final reminder: our last day of school is this Friday, and it will be a half day.
Thank you for an incredible year.  Iâ€™m looking forward to the 19-20 school year with you, but only after all of us have a spiffy summer.
Regards,
Mr. Follet
