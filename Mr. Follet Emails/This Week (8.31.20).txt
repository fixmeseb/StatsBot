Salutations, wonderful students.
On Friday, Dr. Ehrhardt let us know the news that we will remain in Tangerine/Mixed Mode until September 28th. Even though we can’t come onto campus in cohorts, we will look at various ways to bring you safely to CA in the meantime, just in smaller groups. We will also continue to look at methods of helping you interact virtually, from clubs to discussions to Town Hall meetings, the first of which takes place this Friday.
Have a good week, Chargers.
Schedule
We will bask in the normal virtual schedule this week. We are planning our first virtual 2020-2021 US Town Hall on Friday.
Remember, Monday, September 7th is Labor Day, so we will have no classes on that day.
Form Fun
I will be sending out an email shortly with information and links to forms for Parking Contracts and Absence Request forms.
College Visits at CA
*	Virtual College Visits for CA Juniors and Seniors begin this week. Each meeting is scheduled for 30 minutes. To avoid taking class time, “visits” are typically scheduled on Flex Days, at 8:30 am on class days, or occasionally during Clubs.
*	Juniors will learn about this opportunity and how to attend in Tuesday’s Advisory. Seniors, a reminder that Zoom meeting links for each visit are located in SCOIR under "Meeting Link."
*	If you have any questions, please contact Ms. Diana Stelmack.
