Salutations, esteemed leaners,
Huzzah!  Tomorrow, we will bid adieu to cohorts, celebrating Yellow Mode in their place.  Enjoy being present with all your classmates.  Enjoy the learning (which you are naturally owning), the weather (which you are naturally enjoying), and the campus (which you are naturally filling).
While you are on campus, please continue to model appropriate behavior, wearing your masks unless you are eating.  As well, even with the giddiness of having almost everyone back on campus, please continue to respect space and boundaries.
This week’s schedule
This week the entire Upper School will be on campus in Yellow Mode, except for those who elect to go completely virtual.
*	Seniors who drive can park in the US lot.
*	 Juniors and sophomores who drive should park on the hill.
*	The Sophomores will take the PreACT on Wednesday.
