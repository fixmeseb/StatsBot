Salutations, esteemed learners.
Kudos to everyone involved in the CA virtual variety show!  It was fantastic seeing all of the talent.  Bravo, too, to all who participate in the Cary Academy Virtual 5k; we had beautiful weather for runs, walks, and various forms of locomotion.
This week, our juniors and seniors are prepping for AP tests, which begin on May 11.  Here’s a handy link for necessary reminders prior to test day: CLICK HERE. <https://apcoronavirusupdates.collegeboard.org/students/taking-ap-exams/getting-ready-for-exam-day>   As a reminder, if you are taking an AP test, you may miss your synchronous classes on the day of the test.  Just let your teachers know that you will not be able to attend.  Also, starting tomorrow, the College Board will allow you to practice HOW you want to take your test—writing on the computer, employing the keyboard, etc.  Please see their site and find the method that works best for you.
On Monday, Dr. Ehrhardt and I will chat with senior at 11 a.m.  Please join us for a Zoom conference, using the link normally used for senior gatherings.
