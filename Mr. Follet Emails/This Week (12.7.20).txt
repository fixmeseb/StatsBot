Salutations, esteemed learners.
Let us bask in the joy of another normal week, even as we move into the penultimate week of Semester One.
*	A shout-out goes to Student Council and X-Factor; they are continuing to explore ways to celebrate community, even in this hybrid world.  Toward that end, StuCo will release a taped Town Hall this coming week.  In addition, StuCo is planning both a Wacky Olympics and a Spirit Week before break.  Here are some of the details:
Spirit Week:
*	(12/14): Missed My Alarm Monday (PJs)
*	(12/15): Twin Tuesday
*	(12/16): Extreme Blue and Gold (Ft. X-Factor Homecoming Pep Rally)
*	(12/17): Time Travel Thursday (any time in past or future)
*	(12/18): Wacky Tacky Friday (Ft. StuCo Wacky Olympics during Advisory)
Wacky Olympics:
*	This year's Wacky Olympics is going to be recorded and posted virtually
*	Events:
*	INTRO: Varsity Boys & Girls Basketball Trick shots
*	EVENT #1: Giant Tic Tac Toe
*	EVENT #2: Rubik’s Cube
*	EVENT #3: Teacher Hula Hooping
*	EVENT #4: 2 vs. 2 Dodgeball
*	EVENT #6: Relay
*Be looking for an email to sign up for events from Student Council!*
*	Speaking of Life 2020, we need your feedback.  When you have a few minutes, please complete this survey: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/MV7LTH3
Rather than asking you to complete surveys for each class, we are asking you to complete this one ask.
*	Finally, a shout out to our SciOly team, who took 6th place out of 31 teams in the MockVitational Tournament on Saturday.
Now, here are the necessary details for the week.
