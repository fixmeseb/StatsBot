Salutations, esteemed learners.
Welcome to Discovery Term.  If you have questions about DT details during this time, talk to your DT student leaders or faculty advisors, and check Dr. McElreath’s emails.
Also, please remember that the Upper School building is off limits.  You are not allowed inside the building or the fencing around the building.  Otherwise, the normal boundaries remain in place during Discovery Term.  In other words, you can stay on the Quad or in buildings around the Quad.  You should avoid visiting the Middle School, since classes are still in session.  You should avoid going off campus unless it’s a scheduled part of your DT or you have an appointment and you get permission from your parents, communicated to the Upper School attendance.
If you drive to school, please park on Fire Drill Hill.
Have fun!
