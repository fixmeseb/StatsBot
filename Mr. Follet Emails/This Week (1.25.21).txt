Salutations, esteemed learners.
Starting Monday, we begin a lovely run of normal weeks.  Bask in the normalcy as we enjoy the Flex Day this Wednesday, all while finishing the first month of January—kind of hard to believe, isn’t it?
I offer you a few reminders:
o   Don’t forget about the required Social Institute work this Wednesday.
o   Continue to employ the 3 w’s.
o   See Mr. Roszel’s email from CA WISE and SEEDS about Spirit Week opportunities THIS week.
o   Enjoy your classes.
