799630231685693460|Astroturtle#9056 [#rules]: Now, those of you who have taken US history will know what "salutary neglect" means. If you do not, I advise you look it up. I do not actually care whether you are online during class. The above post basically serves as a disclaimer that it is you held responsible for being online during class, and not the server.
~~So basically just ignore that these two posts exist~~ (8:00)
799630218914037770|Astroturtle#9056 [#rules]: The Cary Academy discord server has been growing ever larger - as such, I find it likely that it will soon, if not already, come to the attention of faculty members. I have no idea what that will entail, but if they ever try to disband the server I can make a very solid defense for its survival in the name of community, given an addition to the rules. That addition is this: during class, you are not allowed to be online or active on this server or the rest of discord. This server is only for use during free periods, lunch, or outside of school hours. (8:00)

759218893242892298|Astroturtle#9056 [#rules]: Any server member can nominate any server member for the active or admin role, with a cooldown period of one month. Admins will vote on the nomination. A new active member requires at least a 50% vote. A new admin requires at least a 60% vote. Server owner gets 1.1x votes as a tiebreaker and has the power of veto in case things get way out of hand. Percentages subject to change upon experimentation. Admin votes close after either 24 hours or every admin has voted on the nomination. In case of nomination overflow, there will be a maximum of three nominations voted on in a day, in order of first posted to last. If you want to nominate someone, @ or DM an admin. If someone finds a way to abuse this nomination system, it will be revoked.

Also I'm going to put the limit at 3 admins per class. (21:00)
