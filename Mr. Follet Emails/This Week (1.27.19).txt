Esteemed students,
Even with a short week last week, we still packed quite a bit in.  I want to offer a special thank you to all who provided feedback regarding the NHS speakers, along with those who continued the discussions in positive forums that encouraged all voices.  We will continue to develop methods of exploring challenging ideas with multiple points of view; look for communication from various group leaders in the coming few weeks about more opportunities to talk.  In the meantime, I want to emphasize one important point: we have an incredible student body—all of you belong here.  Thank you for all the gifts you bring.
Now, for the coming week, please peruse these details.
This Week
