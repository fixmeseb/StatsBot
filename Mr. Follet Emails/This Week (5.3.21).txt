Salutations, esteemed students.
Welcome to the penultimate full week of classes for the 2020-2021 school year.  See below for all the salient details of the week.  Also, please note that the week of May 10 will have an altered schedule.  See the dates at the end of this email for more details.
Dress Code
Please follow it.  If you have questions, ask a dean.  Not sure where to read about the Dress Code?  Look for “US Handbook” under Resources in your Blackbaud portal, and then search the handbook for the dress code.
Lunch
Clean up after yourselves.  Clean up after your friends.  Keep the campus clean.  As well, please continue to follow the safety protocols, for your health and the health of the community.  Keep safe distances, and when you are not eating, make sure that you are wearing your masks.
Parking
Avoid driving down to the Lower Campus during days when Coach Jones says you can’t drive down there.  And if Mr. Wacenske, directs you to a different parking spot, you are expected to listen to him.
