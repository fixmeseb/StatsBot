Salutations, esteemed learners in both Blue and Gold Cohorts.
The faculty and staff LOVED seeing you back on campus this past week!  And if you weren’t able to join us, no worries—we look forward to the time when we are ALL gathered together again at school.

Lunch observations
Last week’s lunch rotation was a series of tasty lessons.  Let’s recap the goodness, shall we?
*	Enjoy your food—either hot or cold.
*	Keep six feet of distance.
*	Only two people can sit at the tables, but you can gather the white folding chairs around as well—provided you maintain six feet of distance.
*	If you sit on the stairs, please keep six feet of distance.
*	And, should you want to peruse your gustatorial options while in line for lunch, please consider downloading the Touch of Sage app to your phone.

A Library Morsel
Mr. Pugsley offers this reminder about using the rooms in the library:
“When in study rooms, the doors should stay open. From what I’ve seen, the students are in virtual classes and are just trying to be respectful of those around them, but it’s ideal if they leave the doors open.”  Consider bringing headphones with you, if you plan to use those rooms.
